You can read about the inception and running of the Neuromatch Academy summer school in this very interesting and informative blog by blog by Gunnar Blohm. Or you can read about the dramatic last minute ban of Iranian students and TAs in 2020 due to some US sanctions and then even more dramatic laster minute lift of the ban. Or you can read the paper about how Neuromatch has championed global accessibility. Neuromatch Academy 2021 was particularly significant for me as I created some of the course content and made the concept maps with the help of my 7 year old daughter. The process of writing material for Neuromatch is very edifying. I had the pleasure of discussing content materials with other content creators (Ella Batty, Arvind Kumar and Ulrik Beierholm) before and while writing the tutorials, as well as getting feedback from pre-pod teaching assistants before the tutorials were released. After all that there was a post-production team that made sure everything worked and edited and subtitled the videos. As someone who enjoys teaching, rarely have I had the time or resources to have a team to help develop the materials so this was a highlight of my teaching year and perhaps a high point of my 20+ years of teaching. The Neuromatch materials are excellent and accessible to everyone across all time zones, so the next barrier to learning is ensuring that the students feel they can ask questions. A solution to this happened organically. Some of the volunteers were so invested in the materials they made playlists, tribute songs and comedy routines. None of this trivialized the content but were an Ode to the Joy of the materials. While these tributes might not directly impact the learning outcomes they created a more convivial learning atmosphere for the students, which can only be a good thing. Here, I will write about the link between music and Neuromatch and why I made playlists for the Neuromatch summer schools.  Music and Teaching  I began playing songs in lectures when due to COVID-19 we were forced to move to remote teaching. I felt that the start of every online lecture was very abrupt and to be honest I felt awkward as the only person with their camera on. Normally, with in person lectures I would begin by chatting about different things to help the students relax and encourage engagement. This was not possible in an online setting as for a multitude of different reasons most students could not turn on their cameras or microphones. I wanted to find a way to reduce both my own and their awkwardness and encourage engagement, so I decided to start every class with a song that had some link to the lecture content. The songs acted as a sound check for the students and as an ice-breaker and change of pace for everyone. During the monotony and exhaustion of teaching online, picking songs that would have some relevance to the materials was both fun and challenging. The songs ranged from classical to pop to rock to jazz. For example, I picked the excellent “Zombie” by Fela Kuti to motivate a lecture on predator-prey models, and I was enjoying the song so much that I started dad chair-dancing along with my camera on, which I hope made everyone feel embarrassed but also feel a bit more at ease. I choose to play Zombie by Fela Kuti at the start of the predator prey lecture which was pretty cool so I half-chair danced along because it is a great song, which was embarrassing for everyone. Once again, I nailed my peak \u0026quot;cool\u0026quot; dad maths lecturer status. https://t.co/16JIbjF4Nw pic.twitter.com/XjyHr56MPl\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) March 16, 2021  Other examples included picking “Sisyphus” by Andrew Bird to illustrate that most Numerical Methods are repeating the same thing again and again like rolling a rock up a hill. The most kudos I received for a song choice was when I played “The Boys In The Better Land” by Fontaines DC, which was not relevant to the lecture but the band had just been nominated for a Grammy. Overall, the student reaction was positive, maybe not about all the song choices, but they responded well to the rational, and it generated some chat and added variety to the day. Now to Neuromatch playlists.\nThe Neuromatch Playlists As Neuromatch Academy in 2021 was massive with almost 5000 students from over 100 countries split between the computational neuroscience summer school and the deep learning summer school. Finding a link with the other members of neuromatch can seem daunting. The student engamement team did an excellent job organising events and even having a Neuromatch Academy's Got Talent which included musical, comedy, art and t-shirt design competitions. So to contribute in a small way I made two playlist one for each Neuromatch summer school with the lofty goals: Neuromatch Academy in 2021 had almost 5000 students from over 100 countries split between the Computational Neuroscience Summer School (June 30th-July 23rd, 2021) and the Deep Learning Summer School (August 2nd -August 23rd, 2021). So finding a link with the other members of Neuromatch and the materials could seem daunting. The student engagement team did an excellent job organising events such as a Neuromatch Academy’s got talent including a music, comedy, art and t-shirt design competitions. To contribute in a small way I made two playlists one for each Neuromatch Summer School with the lofty goals:   as a tribute the amazing course materials,   to add some levity to the learning experience,  to hopefully help some students make a connect to each other and the materials,  to encourage myself to look at all the materials,  lastly, as a thank you to all the people involved in organising Neuromatch Academy.   Computational Neuroscience Playlist Computational Neuroscience Summer School started with a Python refresher which I paired it with “Holst: The Planets”. In particular the song “Jupyter: the Bringer of Joy”, which in my mind is the unofficial anthem of Computational Neuroscience Neuromatch as I believe Neuromatch is the Bringer of Joy to many students. To give a sample of the songs and the links, I picked “Don’t Give Up” Peter Gabriel \u0026amp; Kate Bush for the Dynamical Systems day to illustrate that the modelling of inhibition and excitation is like a beautiful duet between two equations. Also, this is the midpoint of the materials which can be a daunting moment for the students, so I figured the sentiment of the song seemed relevant:\n 🎶“Don’t give up now\nWe’re proud of who you are\nDon’t give up\nYou know it’s never been easy.”🎶\n Here is the complete tweet thread for choosing each song and my motivation for the Computational Neuroscience Summer School\n@neuromatch starts tomorrow with a Python refresher.\nI’m going to give a musical pairing for each day.\nFor W0D1 my suggestion is Holst: The Planets.\nIn particular, Jupyter: the Bringer of Joy.\nBest of luck to all the students and TAs I hope it brings joy\nhttps://t.co/gC6Vdgpfmg\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) June 27, 2021  and the corresponding Computational Neuroscience Summer School Spotify playlist:  Deep Learning Playlist This is the first year of the Deep Learning  summer school. So I figured the unofficial anthem would be the adapted song lyrics from \"In Too Deep\" by Sum 41 which might be a window into the minds of how some of the organisers and students: This is the first year of the Deep Learning Neuromatch Summer School. I started with “Rolling in the Deep” by Adele as the students were straight into the deep with the basics and Pytorch. On the Optimization day I paired “In too Deep” by Sum 41 which might have been a window into the minds of how some of the organisers and students were feeling:  🎶\"'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep\nUp above in my head, instead of going under\"\nInstead of going under I did neuromatch DL.🎶  Hopefully, this provided some reassurance to all students that there are moments when we all feel like we are in too deep when learning something new but have trust the process. Here is the full Deep Learning tweet thread with the details of the sometimes tenuous motivation of why I picked each song: Here is my full playlist for @neuromatch Deep Learning.\nMy song for Basics And Pytorch (W1D1) by Shubh Pachchigar, @haltakov , Matthew Sargent, @KordingLab is\n“Rolling in the Deep” by Adele\n1/16https://t.co/BbzxkJdVz4\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) August 3, 2021  and the corresponding Spotify Deep Learning Summer School playlist:  Musical Tribute On the last day of the Deep Learning course, as part of the music competition, Megan Peters (Chairperson of Neuromatch) knocked the musical tributes to Neuromatch out of the park with her amazing song inspired by The Bee Gees “How Deep is Your Love?” and a small suggestion from Gunnar Blohm. Megan rewrote the song as “How Deep Can You Learn?”. Megan’s includes brilliant lyrics such as:  🎶“We’re living in a neural net, optimizing…. When we all should generalise!”🎶  It is a true musical and Deep Learning genius and I believe it should be the Neuromatch Deep Learning anthem.  Ode to Joy  For myself, making the playlists was enjoyable, I found some new music, and I read the course materials. I will be dipping back into them both again and again and again as they are excellent songs and materials. The songs and their links to the materials generated a bit of discussion on twitter and on the summer schools discord music channels, which was nice. Finally, I hope that when people listen to the playlists they know it as a grateful thank you from me to the students, the TAs, the volunteers and the board of Neuromatch. My final musical parings for @neuromatch are:\n\u0026quot;You\u0026#39;re Welcome\u0026quot; form Moana,\n\u0026quot;Danke Schön\u0026quot; by Wayne Newton\n\u0026quot;Ode to Joy\u0026quot; by Beethoven\nNeuromatch has been a highlight of my year so you\u0026#39;re welcome😉\nThank you to all the students, TAs and volunteers It has been a true \u0026quot;Ode to Joy\u0026quot; 1/2 https://t.co/SEMGRuSj9o\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) July 23, 2021  ","date":1628553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628553600,"objectID":"7508c3b09a02a94967995e22c60a616f","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/neuromatchplaylist/","publishdate":"2021-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/neuromatchplaylist/","section":"talk","summary":"Neuromatch Playlist.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"The Music of Neuromatch","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"In 2021 I helped organise a very enjoyable Pint of Science event.\nLooking forward to three excellent @pintofscienceIE talks on Health from DNA to Microbes to Health Informatics Wednesday at 18:30 @WeAreTUDublin Get your tickets here:https://t.co/yxq2PXRZJr pic.twitter.com/myeNq0F4tV\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) May 18, 2021 ","date":1621296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621296000,"objectID":"59ec24ea1ece9215855522f34bd3c88b","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/pos2021/","publishdate":"2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pos2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Pint of Science 2021.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"Health Buzz","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Saoirse McCrann","James Loughman","John S Butler","Ian Flitcroft"],"categories":null,"content":"New @FrontYoungMinds paper for kids by @Saoirse_mcC @jamesloughman me and @IanFlitcroft about the possible relationship between smartphones and shortsightedness. @ceri https://t.co/PikBb8j8Bu\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) April 7, 2021 ","date":1617926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617926400,"objectID":"43e87779ab5c117300c733432473da0b","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/frontiersforyoungmindsopto/","publishdate":"2021-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/frontiersforyoungmindsopto/","section":"talk","summary":"Frontiers for Young Minds.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"Do smartphones hurt our eyes by causing shortsightedness?","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Introducing...

The note book will follow the flow of the original paper and reproduce each figure.\nMaterial and Methods The two-variable network model  Figure 1: Model Architecture and Coherence-Dependent Stochastic inputs. (A) Schematic depiction of the model. There are two pyramidal cell groups (A and B), each of which is selective to one of the two stimuli (mimicking motion to the right or left). Within each pyramidal neural group there is strong recurrrent excitatory connections that can sustain persistent activity triggered by a transient preferred stimulus. The two neural groups compete through feedback inhibition from interneurons.\n(B) Top: the inputs are Poisson rates that vary in time and obey Gaussian distributions, with means μA and μB and with standard deviation σ. The means $μ_A$ and $μ_B$ depend on the coherence level linearly (insert). Bottom: an example of stochastic inputs to neural groups A and B with $μ_0$ = 40 and $σ$ = 10 in Hz, c′ = 6.4%. At every 50 ms, the two stimuli are independently resampled using their Gaussian distributions, so that the inputs vary stochastically in time. If $σ$ = 0, the two inputs would be constant in time.\nThe Cortical Network Model The corical network consists of N=2000 neurons with excitaroty pyramidal cells ($N_E$=1600) and inhibitory $N_I$ interneurons ($N_I$=400).\nNeurons The Integrate and Fire Model The nuerons are simulated unsing the integrate and fire model: \\begin{equation} C_m\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} =-g_L(V(t)-V_L)-I_{syn}(t), \\end{equation} where $V(t)$ is the membrane potential, $C_m$ is the membrane capacity, $g_L$ is the membrane leak conductance, $V_L$ is the resting potential and $I_{syn}$ represents the total synaptic current flow.

Model Reproduces Salient Characteristics of Decision-Correlated Neural Activity in LIP  Figure 3. Decision Dynamics with Inputs of Zero Coherence (A) Two trial simulations (red, neural group A; blue, neural group B). From top to bottom: raster, population firing rates rA and rB, stochastic inputs, and time integrals of inputs. In these two examples, decision choice (A or B) is correlated with the larger time integral of the input.\n(B) Network dynamics in the decision space for the same two trials as in (A). Note the initial random walk along the diagonal line (when the population activity is similar for the two groups); afterwards the network converges to one of the two attractors (at [rA = 20 Hz, rB = 3 Hz] and [rA = 3 Hz, rB = 20 Hz].\n(C) Histogram of the difference in the input time integral for trials in which the decision choice is A (red curve) or B (blue curve). For trials where attractor A wins, the average I standard deviation of ΔS is 0.8 ± 3, whereas for trials where attractor B wins, it is −0.7 ± 3 (n = 1000, σ = 10 Hz, and stimulus duration is 1 s).\n Figure 4. Performance and Population Activity Time Courses (A) Neurometric functions (% correct). Data are fitted by Weibull functions. Filled circle: noisy stimuli (σ = 4 Hz) with symmetrical dependence of the mean values on input coherence (the ratio of the slopes is ρA/ρB = 1). Open circle: without noise in the stimulus (σ = 0), the network\u0026rsquo;s performance is virtually the same. Filled square: asymmetrical dependence of the mean stimuli on coherence (the ratio of the slopes is ρA/ρB = 4). The coherence threshold is slightly lower.\n(B) Time course of population activity for four coherence levels. Black curves, the choice is the preferred stimulus; gray curves, the choice is the nonpreferred stimulus. Correct trials are indicated by solid curves, error trials by dashed curves.\n Figure 5. Reaction Time Simulations Same parameters as in Figure 4.\n(A) During a 2 s stimulation, at the moment when one of the two neural groups reaches a fixed threshold (15 Hz) of population firing activity, the decision is made and the deliberation or decision time is read out. The decision time is longer and more variable at low coherence (left) than at high coherence (right). This is further quantified by the decision time histogram (bottom), which has a larger mean and is broader at low coherence (left) than at high coherence (right).\n(B) Left: Neurometric functions for the reaction time stimulation (circle) and with fixed stimulus duration of 1 s (square). The coherence threshold (defined by 82% correct) is αRT = 8.4% and αFD = 10.4%. Right: Average decision time is linear in the logarithm of the coherence level, ranging from 200 ms at high c′ to 800 ms at low c′. At very low coherence there is a saturation. Note the large standard deviation of decision time, especially at low coherence.\nFigure 6. Dependence of the Decision Performance on the Duration of Stimulus Presentation The stimulus offset is followed by a fixed delay of 2 s, and the decision choice is based on which of the two attractors wins the competition.\n(A) Neurometric function is shifted to the left with longer stimuli.\n(B) Coherence threshold (α defined by 82% correct choices) decreases with the stimulus duration and plateaus for stimulus presentation longer than 1.5 s.\n Figure 7. Optimal Decision-Making Performance Requires Sufficiently Strong and Slow Synaptic Reverberations (A) When the strength of recurrent connections is weaker (w+ = 1.4 instead of w+ = 1.7), attractor dynamics can no longer be sustained by intrinsic network excitation. Neural activities of subpopulation A (left) and B (right) are shown at two coherence levels (1.6% and 51.2%). Same conventions as in Figure 2. In this case, there is a reduced time integration (ramping activity), categorical choice at low coherence is lost, and mnemonic persistent activity is absent during the delay period.\n(B) Network behavior with an increased strength of recurrent connections (w+ = 1.8). Left: population activities in ten individual trials for the control (red, neural group A; blue, neural group B) and for enhanced recurrency (purple, neural group A; green, neural group B). With stronger excitatory reverberations, persistent activity level is doubled (from 20 Hz in control to 40 Hz), and the integration time of stimulus is shortened by a half. The performance is reduced from 72% to 60% correct at c′ = 6.4%. Right: the network\u0026rsquo;s performance is worse, with the neurometric function\u0026rsquo;s threshold increased from 8.4% (red) to 15.6% (purple).  (A) The input signal is reversed during stimulation, where the signal strength is weak (6.4%) and the same before and after the reversal. Percentage choices for A and B as function of the onset time of reversal. The dependence is initially linear as a function of the time of reversal, consistent with an integration of the first and second inputs of the opposite signs. However, the behavioral performance is no longer affected if signal reversal occurs too late (e.g., the reversal time is larger than 700 ms after the stimulus onset), when the network becomes dominated by the intrinsic attractor dynamics.\n(B) Even when the signal is reversed 1 s after the stimulus onset, the decision is still reversable by a more powerful input. Percentage choices for A and B as function of the coherence level of the reversed signal. When the new input is sufficiently large (coherence above 70%–80%), the decision is always reversed in favor of the “new evidence.”\n(C) Examples for control (top) and signal reversal from c′ = 6.4% to −80% at 1 s after the stimulus onset (bottom). Note the slow ramp-down of population activity in group A (red), and ramp-up of population activity in group B (blue) during the second half of the stimulation when the decision is reversed.\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549324800,"objectID":"a864892797ddf91a926de19be38e77cf","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/decision/wang2002/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/decision/wang2002/","section":"Decision","summary":"Jupyter Notebook of the Neuron paper by Wang (2002) titled Probabilistic Decision Making by Slow Reverberation in Cortical Circuits","tags":[],"title":"Probabilistic Decision Making by Slow Reverberation in Cortical Circuits","type":"Decision"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

On the other hand, if there is a shortage in the number of prey, the number of predators will decrease due to the scaricty of food source [1].\nFish and Salmon In a balanced eco system the relationship between small fish (prey) and salmon (predator) can be described mathematically using a Loketta-Volterra model [2-4] \\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{d F}{dt}=F-0.02SF,\\\n\\frac{d S}{dt}=-0.05S+0.001 F S,\\\n\\end{array} \\end{equation} this set of equations models the interaction between small fish (F) and salmon (S).\nThe equations can be written in words as:\n   The rate of change of population is equal to the current population with a control factor     The increase in fish population $\\frac{d F}{dt}$ is equal to the current fish population $F$ minus the amount of fish salmon eat $-0.02FS$   The increase in salmon population $\\frac{d S}{dt}$ is equal to the current salmon population $-0.05S$ plus the amount of fish salmon eat $+0.001FS$    Or they can be summed up as the salmon are the predators who eat the small fish to survive.\nFigure 2 shows a simulation of the populations of salmon and small fish from 2000 to 2100, assuming that nothing is added to enviroment. The salmon population fluxuates between 45 and 55 billion while the small fish population fluctuates from 25 to 85 billion. The equation illustates a relative equilibrium between the two populations ensuring neither population gets too big or too small.\n# INITIAL CONDITIONS N=10000 time = np.linspace(2000, 2100, N ) # time h=100/N fish=50*np.ones(N) # 60 billions small fish salmon=45*np.ones(N) # 30 billion salmon SMALLFISH = np.array( [1,-0.02]) SALMON= np.array([-0.05,0.001]) for i in range (1,N): fish[i]=fish[i-1]+h*fish[i-1]*(SMALLFISH[0]+SMALLFISH[1]*salmon[i-1]) salmon[i]=salmon[i-1]+h*salmon[i-1]*(SALMON[0]+SALMON[1]*fish[i-1]) ## PLOTTING fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,4)) plt.plot(time, fish, \u0026#39;r-\u0026#39;, label=\u0026#39;small fish\u0026#39;) plt.plot(time, salmon, \u0026#39;b-\u0026#39;, label=\u0026#39;salmon\u0026#39;) plt.grid() plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;time (years)\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Population (billions)\u0026#39;) plt.title(\u0026#39;Figure 2: Predator Predy relationship of Salmon and small fish\u0026#39;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026#39;best\u0026#39;) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() Humans Human population growth Humans are adaptable omnivores who have fire and tools so we are able to eat most animals and plants [5]. This means humans violate this the cyclical relationship. When humans have eaten all of one prey, such as the dodo, we just move on to another prey with seemingly little impact on human population growth. From 1800 to 1900 the human population increased by 60% from 1 billion to 1.6 billion. From 1900 to 2000 the human population has increased by almost 400% from 1.6 to 6 billion. Figure 3 shows the predicted increase in human population (yellow) in billions from 6 billion in 2000 to around 16 billion in 2100. The population should level off as number of foods sources can only sustain so many huamns. This growth can be descibed as a the equation: \\begin{equation} \\frac{d H}{dt}=0.05H-0.003H^2, \\end{equation} where $H$ is human population. The equations can be written in words as:\n   Rate of change of Population is equal to the current population and a control factor     The increase in human population $\\frac{d H}{dt}$ is equal to the current human population $0.05H$ minus a factor to control for over population $-0.003H^2$   It can be summed up as the human population keeps increasing until there is nothing left to eat.      humans=6*np.ones(N) # 6 billion humans for i in range (1,N): humans[i]=humans[i-1]+h*humans[i-1]*(0.05-0.003*humans[i-1]) fig= plt.figure(figsize=(8,4)) plt.plot(time, humans, \u0026#39;y-\u0026#39;, label = \u0026#39;Humans\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;time (yrs)\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Population (billions)\u0026#39;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026#39;best\u0026#39;) plt.tight_layout() plt.ylim(0,20) plt.title(\u0026#39;Figure 3: Human Population\u0026#39;) plt.show() Impact of Humans Due to the increasing human population the demand on food sources is getting highter and higher. This demand could put popular food sources at risk of being eaten into extinction. In the recent decades, governments have tried to address this by introduction quotas and identifying at risk animals. While this can address the direct impact of humans on the ecosystem it does not address the indirect by products of modern life such as microplastics.\nMicroPlastics and Humans Microplastics is any plastic entity which is approximately less than 5mm in size [6] (http://www.dit.ie/physics/research/microplastics/). The increase in microplastics can be modelled as a relationship with the human population. This can be descrived by the equation:\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{d P}{dt}=plastic_{rate}H. \\end{array} \\end{equation}\nThe parameter $plastic_{rate}$ is used the describe the relationship between the human population (H) and the rate of increase in microplastics (P) production.\n   The rate of change of population is equal to $=$ the current population with a control factor     The increase in microplastics $\\frac{d P}{dt}$ is equal to $=$ the current human population $H$ times the plastic production rate $plastic_{rate}$    Positive values of production rate mean the more humans, the more microplastics. Even if the production of micropalstics is stopped, the amount of microplastics will remain the same.

The figure plots modelled microplastics (green) and human population as a function of time from 2000 to 2100.\nplastic_model(0.01); Microplastics and Fish While fishing quotas account for the direct impact of man on fish it does not account for by-products of modern life like mircroplastics to the ecosystem. It has been documented that fish are now consuming microplastics which can impact the population of fish.\nFor these reasons we consider microplastics as a predator of small fish. To model the impact of microplastics on small fish (prey) and the knock on effect it has on salmon (prey).\nTo model the negative impact of microplastics on the small fish population an extra term is added to the small fish equation: \\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{d F}{dt}=F-0.02SF-0.01FP.\\\n\\end{array} \\end{equation}\n   The rate of change of population is equal to $=$ the current population with a control factor     The change in small fish $\\frac{d F}{dt}$ is equal to $=$ the current fish population $F$ minus the amount salmon eat $-0.02SF$ minus the amount that die due to microplastics $-0.01FP$    The ecosystem model Bringing all these equations together results in a system of four first order differential equations which describe a simple ecosystem of,\nthe population of Small Fish (F), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d F}{dt}=F-0.02SF-0.01FP; \\end{equation} the population of salmon (S), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d S}{dt}=-0.05S+0.001 F S; \\end{equation} plastic production (P), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d P}{dt}=plastic_{rate}H; \\end{equation} and human population (H), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d H}{dt}=0.0001H-0.002H^2+0.0006SH+0.001HF. \\end{equation} The system was modeled from 2000 to the year 2100 are shown in the Figures bellow for different plastic rates.

The introduction of microplastics results in a decrease in the small fish population which then impacts the salmon population as small fish are their primary food source.\nplastic_fish_model(0.05) If the production rate of plastics is doubled to 0.1. The introduction of microplastics in to the ecosystem will lead to the extinction of small fish (red) by 2080 and salmon (blue) will be more or less extinct by 2100.\nplastic_fish_model(0.1) Open Questions The model shows the destructive impact of microplastics on a simple ecosystem model of small fish, salmon, microplastics and humans. Mathematical models of this type can be used to discuss\nThe immediate questions that arise from this simulation are:\n What is our current rate of plastic production? How will the extinction of small fish impact the human population? How can we do to prevent this from happening?
