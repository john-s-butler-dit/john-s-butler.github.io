The purpose of this evidence synthesis was to analyse the available data regarding the role of lutein and zeaxanthin for cognition in children and propose a theoretical basis for future studies. Methods: The PubMed, Scopus, the ISRCTN registry and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies that evaluated the relationship between lutein and zeaxanthin and cognitive function in children. Reference list and ancestry searches were performed on relevant articles. A total of 543 articles were identified, of which six cross-sectional studies were included. Results: The literature search revealed that the evidence concerning the effect of lutein and zeaxanthin on cognition in children is sparse. However, there is some preliminary evidence indicating a positive association between lutein and zeaxanthin and cognition in childhood. Conclusions: The cross-sectional nature of the few studies available and the lack of RCT data indicates a need for further investigation before any firm conclusions can be drawn.","tags":["Optometry","Macular Pigment","Myopia"],"title":"Lutein and zeaxanthin: The possible contribution, mechanisms of action and implications of modern dietary intake for cognitive development in children.","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1559088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559088000,"objectID":"53eb658f2136c728ceaa0720971b793b","permalink":"/talk/brightclub/","publishdate":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/brightclub/","section":"talk","summary":"Bright Club Dublin.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"A Mathematicians Adventures in Neuroscience (Part 1)","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559088000,"objectID":"9eb62df3bd5d3a625a72a40f8f5ec0ff","permalink":"/outreach/brightclub2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreach/brightclub2019/","section":"outreach","summary":"Birght Club.","tags":null,"title":"A mathematicians adventure in Neuroscience","type":"outreach"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558483200,"objectID":"f623d9f708945ee6024d786ee89dc351","permalink":"/outreach/pos2018/","publishdate":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreach/pos2018/","section":"outreach","summary":"Pint of Science 2018.","tags":null,"title":"An intrduction to Visual Vestibular Integration for self-motion.","type":"outreach"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Methods: MOSAIC is an investigator-led, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of 0.01% atropine for managing progression of myopia. During Phase 1 of the trial, 250 children aged 6-16 years with progressive myopia instil eye drops once nightly in both eyes from randomisation to month 24. No treatment is given during Phase 2 from month 24 to 36 (washout period) for those participants initially randomised to the intervention arm (n=167), during which any potential rebound effects on cessation of treatment will be monitored. All participants initially assigned to the placebo (n=83) crossover to the intervention arm of the study for Phase 2, and from month 24 to 36, instil 0.01% atropine eye drops in both eyes once nightly. Further treatment and monitoring beyond 36 months is planned (Phase 3) and will be designed dependent on the outcomes of Phase 1. Results: The primary outcome measure is cycloplegic spherical equivalent refractive error progression at 24 months. Secondary outcome measures include axial length change as well as the rebound, safety and acceptability profile of 0.01% atropine. Additional analyses will include the mechanisms of action of 0.01% atropine for myopia control. Conclusions: The generalisability of results from previous clinical trials investigating atropine for myopia control is limited by the predominantly Asian ethnicity of previous study populations. MOSAIC is the first RCT to explore the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of unpreserved 0.01% atropine in a predominantly White population.","tags":["Optometry","Macular Pigment","Myopia"],"title":"Myopia Outcome Study of Atropine in Children (MOSAIC): an investigator-led, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial protocol","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S Butler"],"categories":[],"content":" Probabilistic Decision Making by Slow Reverberation in Cortical Circuits Wang Neuron, December 5, 2002, 36:955-968\nIntroduction This notebook will work through the seminal paper by Wang (2002) to simulate synaptic decision making. The note book will follow the flow of the original paper and reproduce each figure.\nMaterial and Methods The two-variable network model  Figure 1: Model Architecture and Coherence-Dependent Stochastic inputs.\n(A) Schematic depiction of the model. There are two pyramidal cell groups (A and B), each of which is selective to one of the two stimuli (mimicking motion to the right or left). Within each pyramidal neural group there is strong recurrrent excitatory connections that can sustain persistent activity triggered by a transient preferred stimulus. The two neural groups compete through feedback inhibition from interneurons.\n(B) Top: the inputs are Poisson rates that vary in time and obey Gaussian distributions, with means μA and μB and with standard deviation σ. The means $μ_A$ and $μ_B$ depend on the coherence level linearly (insert). Bottom: an example of stochastic inputs to neural groups A and B with $μ_0$ = 40 and $σ$ = 10 in Hz, c′ = 6.4%. At every 50 ms, the two stimuli are independently resampled using their Gaussian distributions, so that the inputs vary stochastically in time. If $σ$ = 0, the two inputs would be constant in time.\nThe Cortical Network Model The corical network consists of N=2000 neurons with excitaroty pyramidal cells ($N_E$=1600) and inhibitory $N_I$ interneurons ($N_I$=400).\nNeurons The Integrate and Fire Model The nuerons are simulated unsing the integrate and fire model: \\begin{equation} C_m\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} =-g_L(V(t)-VL)-I{syn}(t), \\end{equation} where $V(t)$ is the membrane potential, $C_m$ is the membrane capacity, $g_L$ is the membrane leak conductance, $VL$ is the resting potential and $I{syn}$ represents the total synaptic current flow.

Model Reproduces Salient Characteristics of Decision-Correlated Neural Activity in LIP  Figure 3. Decision Dynamics with Inputs of Zero Coherence\n(A) Two trial simulations (red, neural group A; blue, neural group B). From top to bottom: raster, population firing rates rA and rB, stochastic inputs, and time integrals of inputs. In these two examples, decision choice (A or B) is correlated with the larger time integral of the input.\n(B) Network dynamics in the decision space for the same two trials as in (A). Note the initial random walk along the diagonal line (when the population activity is similar for the two groups); afterwards the network converges to one of the two attractors (at [rA = 20 Hz, rB = 3 Hz] and [rA = 3 Hz, rB = 20 Hz].\n\u0026copy; Histogram of the difference in the input time integral for trials in which the decision choice is A (red curve) or B (blue curve). For trials where attractor A wins, the average I standard deviation of ΔS is 0.8 ± 3, whereas for trials where attractor B wins, it is −0.7 ± 3 (n = 1000, σ = 10 Hz, and stimulus duration is 1 s).\n Figure 4. Performance and Population Activity Time Courses\n(A) Neurometric functions (% correct). Data are fitted by Weibull functions. Filled circle: noisy stimuli (σ = 4 Hz) with symmetrical dependence of the mean values on input coherence (the ratio of the slopes is ρA/ρB = 1). Open circle: without noise in the stimulus (σ = 0), the network\u0026rsquo;s performance is virtually the same. Filled square: asymmetrical dependence of the mean stimuli on coherence (the ratio of the slopes is ρA/ρB = 4). The coherence threshold is slightly lower.\n(B) Time course of population activity for four coherence levels. Black curves, the choice is the preferred stimulus; gray curves, the choice is the nonpreferred stimulus. Correct trials are indicated by solid curves, error trials by dashed curves.\n Figure 5. Reaction Time Simulations\nSame parameters as in Figure 4.\n(A) During a 2 s stimulation, at the moment when one of the two neural groups reaches a fixed threshold (15 Hz) of population firing activity, the decision is made and the deliberation or decision time is read out. The decision time is longer and more variable at low coherence (left) than at high coherence (right). This is further quantified by the decision time histogram (bottom), which has a larger mean and is broader at low coherence (left) than at high coherence (right).\n(B) Left: Neurometric functions for the reaction time stimulation (circle) and with fixed stimulus duration of 1 s (square). The coherence threshold (defined by 82% correct) is αRT = 8.4% and αFD = 10.4%. Right: Average decision time is linear in the logarithm of the coherence level, ranging from 200 ms at high c′ to 800 ms at low c′. At very low coherence there is a saturation. Note the large standard deviation of decision time, especially at low coherence.\nFigure 6. Dependence of the Decision Performance on the Duration of Stimulus Presentation\nThe stimulus offset is followed by a fixed delay of 2 s, and the decision choice is based on which of the two attractors wins the competition.\n(A) Neurometric function is shifted to the left with longer stimuli.\n(B) Coherence threshold (α defined by 82% correct choices) decreases with the stimulus duration and plateaus for stimulus presentation longer than 1.5 s.\n Figure 7. Optimal Decision-Making Performance Requires Sufficiently Strong and Slow Synaptic Reverberations\n(A) When the strength of recurrent connections is weaker (w+ = 1.4 instead of w+ = 1.7), attractor dynamics can no longer be sustained by intrinsic network excitation. Neural activities of subpopulation A (left) and B (right) are shown at two coherence levels (1.6% and 51.2%). Same conventions as in Figure 2. In this case, there is a reduced time integration (ramping activity), categorical choice at low coherence is lost, and mnemonic persistent activity is absent during the delay period.\n(B) Network behavior with an increased strength of recurrent connections (w+ = 1.8). Left: population activities in ten individual trials for the control (red, neural group A; blue, neural group B) and for enhanced recurrency (purple, neural group A; green, neural group B). With stronger excitatory reverberations, persistent activity level is doubled (from 20 Hz in control to 40 Hz), and the integration time of stimulus is shortened by a half. The performance is reduced from 72% to 60% correct at c′ = 6.4%. Right: the network\u0026rsquo;s performance is worse, with the neurometric function\u0026rsquo;s threshold increased from 8.4% (red) to 15.6% (purple).  (A) The input signal is reversed during stimulation, where the signal strength is weak (6.4%) and the same before and after the reversal. Percentage choices for A and B as function of the onset time of reversal. The dependence is initially linear as a function of the time of reversal, consistent with an integration of the first and second inputs of the opposite signs. However, the behavioral performance is no longer affected if signal reversal occurs too late (e.g., the reversal time is larger than 700 ms after the stimulus onset), when the network becomes dominated by the intrinsic attractor dynamics.\n(B) Even when the signal is reversed 1 s after the stimulus onset, the decision is still reversable by a more powerful input. Percentage choices for A and B as function of the coherence level of the reversed signal. When the new input is sufficiently large (coherence above 70%–80%), the decision is always reversed in favor of the “new evidence.”\n\u0026copy; Examples for control (top) and signal reversal from c′ = 6.4% to −80% at 1 s after the stimulus onset (bottom).

On the other hand, if there is a shortage in the number of prey, the number of predators will decrease due to the scaricty of food source [1].\nFish and Salmon In a balanced eco system the relationship between small fish (prey) and salmon (predator) can be described mathematically using a Loketta-Volterra model [2-4] \\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{d F}{dt}=F-0.02SF,\n\\frac{d S}{dt}=-0.05S+0.001 F S,\n\\end{array} \\end{equation} this set of equations models the interaction between small fish (F) and salmon (S).\nThe equations can be written in words as:\n   The rate of change of population is equal to the current population with a control factor     The increase in fish population $\\frac{d F}{dt}$ is equal to the current fish population $F$ minus the amount of fish salmon eat $-0.02FS$   The increase in salmon population $\\frac{d S}{dt}$ is equal to the current salmon population $-0.05S$ plus the amount of fish salmon eat $+0.001FS$    Or they can be summed up as the salmon are the predators who eat the small fish to survive.\nFigure 2 shows a simulation of the populations of salmon and small fish from 2000 to 2100, assuming that nothing is added to enviroment. The salmon population fluxuates between 45 and 55 billion while the small fish population fluctuates from 25 to 85 billion. The equation illustates a relative equilibrium between the two populations ensuring neither population gets too big or too small.\n# INITIAL CONDITIONS N=10000 time = np.linspace(2000, 2100, N ) # time h=100/N fish=50*np.ones(N) # 60 billions small fish salmon=45*np.ones(N) # 30 billion salmon SMALLFISH = np.array( [1,-0.02]) SALMON= np.array([-0.05,0.001]) for i in range (1,N): fish[i]=fish[i-1]+h*fish[i-1]*(SMALLFISH[0]+SMALLFISH[1]*salmon[i-1]) salmon[i]=salmon[i-1]+h*salmon[i-1]*(SALMON[0]+SALMON[1]*fish[i-1]) ## PLOTTING fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,4)) plt.plot(time, fish, 'r-', label='small fish') plt.plot(time, salmon, 'b-', label='salmon') plt.grid() plt.xlabel('time (years)') plt.ylabel('Population (billions)') plt.title('Figure 2: Predator Predy relationship of Salmon and small fish') plt.legend(loc='best') plt.tight_layout() plt.show()  Humans Human population growth Humans are adaptable omnivores who have fire and tools so we are able to eat most animals and plants [5]. This means humans violate this the cyclical relationship. When humans have eaten all of one prey, such as the dodo, we just move on to another prey with seemingly little impact on human population growth. From 1800 to 1900 the human population increased by 60% from 1 billion to 1.6 billion. From 1900 to 2000 the human population has increased by almost 400% from 1.6 to 6 billion. Figure 3 shows the predicted increase in human population (yellow) in billions from 6 billion in 2000 to around 16 billion in 2100. The population should level off as number of foods sources can only sustain so many huamns. This growth can be descibed as a the equation: \\begin{equation} \\frac{d H}{dt}=0.05H-0.003H^2, \\end{equation} where $H$ is human population. The equations can be written in words as:\n   Rate of change of Population is equal to the current population and a control factor     The increase in human population $\\frac{d H}{dt}$ is equal to the current human population $0.05H$ minus a factor to control for over population $-0.003H^2$    It can be summed up as the human population keeps increasing until there is nothing left to eat.\nhumans=6*np.ones(N) # 6 billion humans for i in range (1,N): humans[i]=humans[i-1]+h*humans[i-1]*(0.05-0.003*humans[i-1]) fig= plt.figure(figsize=(8,4)) plt.plot(time, humans, 'y-', label = 'Humans') plt.xlabel('time (yrs)') plt.ylabel('Population (billions)') plt.legend(loc='best') plt.tight_layout() plt.ylim(0,20) plt.title('Figure 3: Human Population') plt.show()  Impact of Humans Due to the increasing human population the demand on food sources is getting highter and higher. This demand could put popular food sources at risk of being eaten into extinction. In the recent decades, governments have tried to address this by introduction quotas and identifying at risk animals. While this can address the direct impact of humans on the ecosystem it does not address the indirect by products of modern life such as microplastics.\nMicroPlastics and Humans Microplastics is any plastic entity which is approximately less than 5mm in size 6. The increase in microplastics can be modelled as a relationship with the human population. This can be descrived by the equation:\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{d P}{dt}=plastic_{rate}H. \\end{array} \\end{equation}\nThe parameter $plastic_{rate}$ is used the describe the relationship between the human population (H) and the rate of increase in microplastics (P) production.\n   The rate of change of population is equal to $=$ the current population with a control factor     The increase in microplastics $\\frac{d P}{dt}$ is equal to $=$ the current human population $H$ times the plastic production rate $plastic_{rate}$    Positive values of production rate mean the more humans, the more microplastics. Even if the production of micropalstics is stopped, the amount of microplastics will remain the same. So even after humans are gone, our plastic foot print will remain.\ndef plastic_model(plastic_rate): humans=6*np.ones(N) # 30 billion salmon plastics=1*np.ones(N) # 1 billion microplastics for i in range (1,N): plastics[i]=plastics[i-1]+h*humans[i-1]*(plastic_rate) humans[i]=humans[i-1]+h*humans[i-1]*(0.05-0.003*humans[i-1]) fig= plt.figure(figsize=(8,3)) plt.plot(time, plastics, 'g', label = 'Microplastics') plt.plot(time, humans, 'y-', label = 'Humans') plt.xlabel('time (yrs)') plt.ylabel('Population') plt.legend(loc='best') plt.tight_layout() plt.title('Figure 4: Relationship of Human Population and Microplastics with a plastic rate = %s'%(plastic_rate)) plt.show()  In Figure 4 the rate of microplastic production can be manipulated to illustrate the result of a change in amount of microplastics. The figure plots modelled microplastics (green) and human population as a function of time from 2000 to 2100.\nplastic_model(0.01);  Microplastics and Fish While fishing quotas account for the direct impact of man on fish it does not account for by-products of modern life like mircroplastics to the ecosystem. It has been documented that fish are now consuming microplastics which can impact the population of fish.\nFor these reasons we consider microplastics as a predator of small fish. To model the impact of microplastics on small fish (prey) and the knock on effect it has on salmon (prey).\nTo model the negative impact of microplastics on the small fish population an extra term is added to the small fish equation: \\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{d F}{dt}=F-0.02SF-0.01FP.\n\\end{array} \\end{equation}\n   The rate of change of population is equal to $=$ the current population with a control factor     The change in small fish $\\frac{d F}{dt}$ is equal to $=$ the current fish population $F$ minus the amount salmon eat $-0.02SF$ minus the amount that die due to microplastics $-0.01FP$    The ecosystem model Bringing all these equations together results in a system of four first order differential equations which describe a simple ecosystem of,\nthe population of Small Fish (F), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d F}{dt}=F-0.02SF-0.01FP; \\end{equation} the population of salmon (S), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d S}{dt}=-0.05S+0.001 F S; \\end{equation} plastic production (P), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d P}{dt}=plastic_{rate}H; \\end{equation} and human population (H), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d H}{dt}=0.0001H-0.002H^2+0.0006SH+0.001HF. \\end{equation} The system was modeled from 2000 to the year 2100 are shown in the Figures bellow for different plastic rates.

The introduction of microplastics in to the ecosystem will lead to the extinction of small fish (red) by 2080 and salmon (blue) will be more or less extinct by 2100.\nplastic_fish_model(0.1)  Open Questions The model shows the destructive impact of microplastics on a simple ecosystem model of small fish, salmon, microplastics and humans. Mathematical models of this type can be used to discuss\nThe immediate questions that arise from this simulation are: 1. What is our current rate of plastic production? 2. How will the extinction of small fish impact the human population? 3. How can we do to prevent this from happening?\nReferences [1] Lynx-hare fur trade.https://theglyptodon.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/the-fur-trades-records/.

Previous studies have demonstrated changes in behavior and gait with increased sensory and cognitive load, but the underlying cortical mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present study, in a mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approach, 16 young adults walked on a treadmill with high-density EEG while 3-dimensional (3D) motion capture tracked kinematics of the head and feet. Visual load was manipulated with the presentation of optic flow with and without continuous mediolateral perturbations. The effects of cognitive load were assessed by the performance of a go/no-go task on half of the blocks. During increased sensory load, participants walked with shorter and wider strides, which may indicate a more restrained pattern of gait. Interestingly, cognitive task engagement attenuated these effects of sensory load on gait. Using an independent component analysis and dipole-fitting approach, we found that cautious gait was accompanied by neuro-oscillatory modulations localized to frontal (supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex) and parietal (inferior parietal lobule, precuneus) areas. Our results show suppression in alpha/mu (8–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) rhythms, suggesting enhanced activation of these regions with unreliable sensory inputs. These findings provide insight into the neural correlates of gait adaptation and may be particularly relevant to older adults who are less able to adjust to ongoing cognitive and sensory demands while walking.","tags":["Visual","Power Spectral Density","Walking","MoBI","EEG"],"title":"Cognitive load reduces the effects of optic flow on gait and electrocortical dynamics during treadmill walking","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"8017a22c147abec6323dd2003b0fa52e","permalink":"/talk/scienceweek2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/scienceweek2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Science Week 2018.","tags":null,"title":"Mathematics and the Brain","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Robert Ramkhalawansingh","John S Butler","Jennifer L Campos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"4edb147ebddc8bfd0d1c48d9dfafa864","permalink":"/publication/2017_aging_heading/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_aging_heading/","section":"publication","summary":"Younger adults integrate visual and vestibular cues to self-motion in a manner consistent with optimal integration; however, little is currently known about whether this process changes with older age. Our objective was to determine whether older adults, like younger adults, display evidence of optimal visual–vestibular integration, including reductions in bimodal variance (Visual-Vestibular) compared with unimodal variance (visual or vestibular alone), and reliability-based cue weighting. We used a motion simulator and a head-mounted display to introduce a 2-interval forced-choice heading estimation task. Older (65+ years) and younger adults (18–35 years) judged which of two movements was more rightward. Movements consisted of vestibular cues (passive movement in darkness), visual cues (optic flow), or both cues combined. The combined condition contained either congruent cues or incongruent cues (either a subtle 5° or larger 20° conflict). Results demonstrated that older adults had less reliable visual heading estimates than younger adults but comparable vestibular heading estimates. During combined, congruent conditions, both age groups exhibited reductions in combined variance, consistent with predicted optimal integration. During subtle cue conflicts, only younger adults exhibited combined variance consistent with predicted optimal integration, but both age groups displayed reliability-based cue weighting. During larger spatial conflicts, neither group demonstrated optimal reductions in variance. Younger adults displayed reliability-based cue weighting but older adults’ heading estimates were biased toward the less reliable visual estimate. Older adults’ tendency to incorporate spatially conflicting and unreliable visual cues into their self-motion percept may affect their performance on mobility-related tasks like walking and driving.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory","Aging"],"title":"Visual–Vestibular Integration During Self-Motion Perception in Younger and Older Adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526947200,"objectID":"132c64dd619126a12f9e862a29aaccf1","permalink":"/outreach/scienceweek2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreach/scienceweek2018/","section":"outreach","summary":"Scienece Week 2018.","tags":null,"title":"Science Week 2018","type":"outreach"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526947200,"objectID":"d8af7a718c837870158511bb4a50e667","permalink":"/talk/pos2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pos2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Pint of Science 2018","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"Visual Vestibular Integration","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Saoirse McCrann","Ian Flitcroft","Kevin Lalor","John S Butler","Aaron Bush","James Loughman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"1dc58a6ac7de74c35b81c325ffae6e03","permalink":"/publication/2018_mccrann/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_mccrann/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:With the increasing prevalence in myopia there is growing interest in active myopia prevention. This study aims to increase our understanding of parental attitudes to myopia development and control, as a means to inform future health planning and policy. It evaluates, for the first time, the attitude of parents to myopia and its associated risks, as well as assessing the exposure of Irish children to environmental factors that may influence their risk profile for myopia development. METHODS: Parents of 8-13 year old children in eight participating schools completed a questionnaire designed to assess their knowledge of and attitudes towards myopia and its risk factors. A structured diary was also used to capture daily activities of children in relation to myopia risk factors. RESULTS: Of 329 parents, just 46% considered that myopia presented a health risk to their children, while an identical number (46%) regarded it as an optical inconvenience. Myopia was also, but less frequently, considered an expense (31% of parents), a cosmetic inconvenience (14% of parents) and, by some, as a sign of intelligence (4% of parents) 76% of parents recognised the potential of digital technology to impact the eye, particularly as a cause of eyestrain and need for spectacles. Only 14% of parents expressed concern should their child be diagnosed with myopia.

Methods: A survey was developed, piloted and distributed for anonymous completion by optometrists registered to practise in Ireland. The survey included 10 five-level Likert items exploring potential barriers to glaucoma detection and a free-text box for partici- pants to comment more broadly. Results: One hundred and ninety-nine optometrists (27 per cent of registrants) responded to the survey. Among the barriers identified, there was notable agreement (71 per cent) with the need for extra training on glaucoma detection. Logistic regression showed that optome- trists without postgraduate qualifications were more likely to agree with the need for extra training (OR 3.2, 95 per cent CI 1.3–8.1).

The neural networks underpinning this condition are incompletely understood. While animal models suggest a role for the superior colliculus in its pathophysiology, this link has yet to be established in humans. The present experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that disrupted superior collicular processing is evident in affected patients and in relatives harbouring a disease-specific endophenotype (abnormal temporal discrimination). The study participants were 16 cervical dystonia patients, 16 unaffected first-degree relatives with abnormal temporal discrimination, 16 unaffected first-degree relatives with normal temporal discrimination and 16 healthy controls. The response of participant’s superior colliculi to looming stimuli was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Cervical dystonia patients and relatives with abnormal temporal discrimination demonstrated (i) significantly reduced superior collicular activation for whole brain and region of interest analysis; (ii) a statistically significant negative correlation between temporal discrimination threshold and superior collicular peak values. Our results support the hypothesis that disrupted superior collicular processing is involved in the pathogenesis of cervical dystonia. These findings, which align with animal models of cervical dystonia, shed new light on pathomechanisms in humans.","tags":["Dystonia","Temporal Discrimination Threshold"],"title":"Disrupted superior collicular activity may reveal cervical dystonia disease pathomechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brenda R Malcolm","John J Foxe","John S Butler","Wenzhu B.

This approach, termed Mobile Brain/ Body Imaging (MoBI), has the potential to elucidate the neural correlates of perceptual and cognitive processes during real-life activities, such as locomotion. However, as of yet, no one has assessed the long-term stability of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded under these conditions. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of cognitive ERPs recorded while walking. High-density EEG was ac- quired from 12 young adults on two occasions, separated by an average of 2.3 years, as they performed a Go/ No-Go response inhibition paradigm. During each testing session, participants performed the task while walking on a treadmill and seated. Using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as a measure of agreement, we fo- cused on two well-established neurophysiological correlates of cognitive control, the N2 and P3 ERPs. Following ICA-based artifact rejection, the earlier N2 yielded good to excellent levels of reliability for both amplitude and latency, while measurements for the later P3 component were generally less robust but still indicative of ade- quate to good levels of stability. Interestingly, the N2 was more consistent between walking sessions, compared to sitting, for both hits and correct rejection trials. In contrast, the P3 waveform tended to have a higher degree of consistency during sitting conditions. Overall, these results suggest that the electro-cortical signals obtained during active walking are representative of stable indices of neurophysiological function.","tags":["Visual","MoBI","Walking","EEG"],"title":"Long-term test-retest reliability of event-related potential (ERP) recordings during treadmill walking using the mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rebecca B Beck","Eavan M McGovern","John S Butler","Dorina Birsanu","Brendan Quinlivan","Ines Beiser","Shruti Narasimham","Sean O'Riordan","Michael Hutchinson","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"a643c320c7275c2b9844aafb67cc5336","permalink":"/publication/2017_beck-jove/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_beck-jove/","section":"publication","summary":"The temporal discrimination threshold (TDT) is the shortest time interval at which an observer can discriminate two sequential stimuli as being asynchronous (typically 30-50 ms).

The pathophysiology of FOG remains poorly understood but is associated with deficits in cognitive function and motor preparation. Method: We studied 20 people with PD (10 with FOG, 10 without FOG) and performed a timed response target detection task while electroencephalographic data were acquired. We analysed the data to detect and examine cortical markers of cognitive decision making (P3b or centroparietal positivity, CPP) and motor readiness potential. We analysed current source density (CSD) to increase spatial resolution and allow identification of distinct signals. Results: There was no difference in the P3b/CPP response between people with PD with and without FOG, suggesting equivalent cognitive processing with respect to decision-making. However, the FOG group had significant difference with an earlier onset and larger amplitude of the lateralized readiness potential. Furthermore, the amplitude of the lateralised readiness potential correlated strongly with total Frontal Assessment Battery score. Conclusions: The difference in lateralized readiness potentials may reflect excessive recruitment of lateral premotor areas to compensate for dysfunction of the supplementary motor area and resultant loss of automatic motor control. This early, excessive recruitment of frontal networks occurs in spite of equivalent motor scores and reaction times between groups. Significance: The saturation of frontal processing mechanisms could help explain deficits in attentional set-shifting, dual-tasking and response inhibition which are frequently reported in FOG.","tags":["Visual","EEG","P3","Parkinson's Disease","Freezing of Gait"],"title":"Motor Preparation Rather Than Decision-Making Differentiates Parkinson's Disease Patients With And Without Freezing of Gait","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eavan M McGovern","John S Butler","Ines Beiser","Laura Williams","Brendan Quinlivan","Shruti Narasiham","Rebecca Beck","Sean O’Riordan","Richard B Reilly","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"b4fabdf4a01a6f58ec00e93bf1fb05ad","permalink":"/publication/2016_mcgovern/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_mcgovern/","section":"publication","summary":"The temporal discrimination threshold (TDT) is the shortest time interval at which an individual detects two stimuli to be asynchronous (normal=30–50ms). It has been shown to be abnormal in patients with disorders affecting the basal ganglia including adult onset idiopathic focal dystonia (AOIFD). Up to 97% of patients have an abnormal TDT with age- and sex-related penetrance in unaffected relatives, demonstrating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. These findings support the use of the TDT as a pre-clinical biomarker for AOIFD. The usual stimulus presentation method involves the presentation of progressively asynchronous stimuli; when three sequential stimuli are reported asynchronous is taken as a participant's TDT. To investigate the robustness of the 'staircase' method of presentation, we introduced a method of randomised presentation order to explore any potential 'learning effect' that may be associated with this existing method. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in temporal discrimination using two methods of stimulus presentation. Thirty healthy volunteers were recruited to the study (mean age 33.73±3.4 years). Visual and tactile TDT testing using a staircase and randomised method of presentation order was carried out in a single session. There was a strong relationship between the staircase and random method for TDT values. This observed consistency between testing methods suggests that the existing experimental approach is a robust method of recording an individual's TDT. In addition, our newly devised randomised paradigm is a reproducible and more efficient method for data acquisition in the clinic setting. However, the two presentation methods yield different absolute TDT results and either of the two methods should be used uniformly in all participants in any one particular study.","tags":["Dystonia","Temporal Discrimination Threshold"],"title":"A comparison of stimulus presentation methods in temporal discrimination testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Williams","Eavan McGovern","Okka Kimmich","Anna Molloy","Ines Beiser","John S Butler","Fiona Molloy","Paul Lonogan","Daniel G Healy","Niall Byrne","Tim Lynch","Helena Moore","Mark J Edwards","Cathal Walsh","Sean O'Riordan","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"40886afaa3ca6a7b58bcb67ede066ff5","permalink":"/publication/2015_williams-epidemilogy/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_williams-epidemilogy/","section":"publication","summary":"Background Adult onset primary torsion dystonia (AOPTD) is a poorly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder; most gene carriers are non-manifesting despite having reached an adequate age for penetrance. It is hypothesised that genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors may exert protective or deleterious effects on penetrance of AOPTD. By examining environmental exposure history in cervical dystonia patients and their similarly aged unaffected siblings we aimed to determine the role of previous environmental exposures in relation to disease penetrance. Methods A case-control study of 67 patients with cervical dystonia and 67 of their age-matched unaffected siblings was performed. Past environmental exposures were assessed using a detailed 124-question standardised questionnaire. Results By univariate analysis, cervical dystonia patients, compared to their unaffected siblings, had an increased frequency of a history of car accidents with hospital attendance (OR 10.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 47.4, p=0.004) and surgical episodes (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.76 to 23.61, p=0.005). Following multivariate analysis, car accidents with hospital attendance (OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 37.6, p=0.017) and all surgical episodes (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.24 to 19.31, p=0.023) remained significantly associated with case status. Conclusions Cervical dystonia patients had a history, prior to symptom onset, of significantly more frequent episodes of surgery and of car accidents with hospital attendance than their age-matched unaffected siblings. Soft tissue trauma appears to increase risk of development of cervical dystonia in genetically predetermined individuals.","tags":["Dystonia","Temporal Discrimination Threshold"],"title":"Epidemiological, clinical and genetic aspects of adult onset isolated focal dystonia in Ireland","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eavan M McGovern","Emer O’Connor","Ines Beiser","Laura Williams","John S Butler","Brendan Quinlivan","Shruti Narasiham","Rebecca Beck","Sean O’Riordan","Richard B Reilly","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"05a6ef1edf496c52c53546cbb7191086","permalink":"/publication/2016_mcgovern-menstral/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_mcgovern-menstral/","section":"publication","summary":"The temporal discrimination threshold (TDT) is a proposed pre-clinical biomarker (endophenotype) for adult onset isolated focal dystonia (AOIFD). Age- and sex-related effects on temporal discrimination demonstrate that women, before the age of 40 years, have faster temporal discrimination than men but their TDTs worsen with age at almost three times the rate of men. Thus after 40 years the TDT in women is progressively worse than in men. AOIFD is an increasingly female-predominant disorder after the age of 40; it is not clear whether this age-related sexually-dimorphic difference observed for both the TDT and sex ratio at disease onset in AOIFD is a hormonal or chromosomal effect. The aim of this study was to examine temporal discrimination at weekly intervals during two consecutive menstrual cycles in 14 healthy female volunteers to determine whether physiological hormonal changes affected temporal discrimination. We observed no significant differences in weekly temporal discrimination threshold values during the menstrual cycles and no significant correlation with the menstrual cycle stage. This observed stability of temporal discrimination during cyclical hormonal change raises interesting questions concerning the age-related sexually-dimorphic decline observed in temporal discrimination.

Movement times are employed as a behavioural metric of performance while dynamic P3b amplitudes and power in the alpha band (approximately 10 Hz) are explored as electrophysiological metrics during visuospatial learning. Results demonstrate that task performance, as measured by movement time, is highly correlated with P3b amplitude and alpha power at a consecutive trial level (trials 1 - 30). The current set of results, in conjunction with the existing literature, suggests that changes in P3b amplitude and alpha power could correspond to different aspects of the learning process. Here it is hypothesized that changes in P3b correspond to a diminishing inter-stimulus-interval and reduced stimulus relevance while the corresponding changes in alpha power represent an automation of response as habituation occurs in participants.

Importantly, comparable sensory deficits have also been established in healthy first-degree biological relatives of patients with schizophrenia and in first-episode drug-naive patients. The clear implication is that these measures are endophenotypic, related to the underlying genetic liability for schizophrenia. However, there is significant overlap between patient response distributions and those of healthy individuals without affected first-degree relatives. Here we sought to develop more sensitive measures of sensory dysfunction in this population, with an eye to establishing endophenotypic markers with better predictive capabilities. We used a sensory adaptation paradigm in which electrophysiological responses to basic visual and somatosensory stimuli presented at different rates (ranging from 250 to 2550 ms interstimulus intervals, in blocked presentations) were compared. Our main hypothesis was that adaptation would be substantially diminished in schizophrenia, and that this would be especially prevalent in the visual system. High-density event-related potential recordings showed amplitude reductions in sensory adaptation in patients with schizophrenia (N = 15 Experiment 1, N = 12 Experiment 2) compared with age-matched healthy controls (N=15 Experiment 1, N = 12 Experiment 2), and this was seen for both sensory modalities. At the individual participant level, reduced adaptation was more robust for visual compared with somatosensory stimulation. These results point to significant impairments in short-term sensory plasticity across sensory modalities in schizophrenia. These simple-to-execute measures may prove valuable as candidate endophenotypes and will bear follow-up in future work.","tags":["Visual","EEG","Schizophrenia","Adaptation","Aging"],"title":"Atypical visual and somatosensory adaptation in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Molloy","Laura Williams","Okka Kimmich","John S Butler","Eavan McGovern","Sean O'Riordan","Richard B Reilly","Cathal Walsh","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"9c233543a22e85bf9cfe3e95e3e51b1d","permalink":"/publication/2014_molloy-latitude/","publishdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_molloy-latitude/","section":"publication","summary":"Background Adult-onset isolated focal dystonia may present with various phenotypes including blepharospasm and cervical dystonia.

There were significant positive associations between the phenotype case ratio and quarter-one (January–March) insolation (p=0.0005, R2=53%) and average annual insolation (p=0.003, R2=40%).\nConclusion The increase in the blepharospasm: cervical dystonia case ratio with decreasing latitude and increasing insolation suggests that sunlight exposure is an environmental risk factor for the development of blepharospasm (rather than cervical dystonia) in individuals genetically susceptible to adult-onset dystonia","tags":["Dystonia","Temporal Discrimination Threshold"],"title":"Sun exposure is an environmental factor for the development of blepharospasm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Neha Uppal","John J Foxe","John S Butler","Frantzy Acluche","Sophie Molholm"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"0366ad01b27e1addd33914a5e36dfd8a","permalink":"/publication/2015_neha-somagatingdevelopment/","publishdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_neha-somagatingdevelopment/","section":"publication","summary":"Young children are often hyperreactive to somatosensory inputs hardly noticed by adults, as exemplified by irritation to seams or labels in clothing. The neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying changes in sensory reactivity are not well understood. Based on the idea that neurodevelopmental changes in somatosensory processing and/or changes in sensory adaptation might underlie developmental differences in somatosensory reactivity, high-density electroencephalography was used to examine how the nervous system responds and adapts to repeated vibrotactile stimulation over childhood. Participants aged 6–18 yr old were presented with 50-ms vibrotactile stimuli to the right wrist over the median nerve at 5 blocked interstimulus intervals (ranging from ∼7 to ∼1 stimulus per second). Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) revealed three major phases of activation within the first 200 ms, with scalp topographies suggestive of neural generators in contralateral somatosensory cortex. Although overall SEPs were highly similar for younger, middle, and older age groups (6.1–9.8, 10.0–12.9, and 13.0–17.8 yr old), there were significant age-related amplitude differences in initial and later phases of the SEP. In contrast, robust adaptation effects for fast vs. slow presentation rates were observed that did not differ as a function of age. A greater amplitude response in the later portion of the SEP was observed for the youngest group and may be related to developmental changes in responsivity to somatosensory stimuli. These data suggest the protracted development of the somatosensory system over childhood, whereas adaptation, as assayed in this study, is largely in place by ∼7 yr of age.","tags":["Somatosensory","EEG","Adaptation","Development"],"title":"The neural dynamics of somatosensory processing and adaptation across childhood: a high-density electrical mapping study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S Butler","Ines M Beiser","Laura Williams","Eavan McGovern","Fiona Molloy","Tim Lynch","Dan G Healy","Helena Moore","Richard Walsh","Richard B Reilly","Sean O Riordan","Cathal Walsh","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"3898bdfd2d9babf897c45e4590b43b37","permalink":"/publication/2015_hutchinson-sexual-dimorphism-and-gaba/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_hutchinson-sexual-dimorphism-and-gaba/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Adult-onset isolated focal dystonia (AOIFD) presenting in early adult life is more frequent in men, whereas in middle age it is female predominant.

This ‘adaptation’ is believed to represent mechanisms by which sensory systems reduce responsivity to consistent environmental inputs, freeing resources to respond to potentially more relevant inputs. While auditory adaptation functions have been relatively well characterized, considerably less is known about visual adaptation in humans. Here, high-density visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded while two paradigms were used to interrogate visual adaptation. The first presented stimulus pairs with varying ISIs, comparing VEP amplitude to the second stimulus with that of the first (paired-presentation). The second involved blocks of stimulation (N = 100) at various ISIs and comparison of VEP amplitude between blocks of differing ISIs (block-presentation). Robust VEP modulations were evident as a function of presentation rate in the block-paradigm, with strongest modulations in the 130–150 ms and 160–180 ms visual processing phases. In paired-presentations, with ISIs of just 200–300 ms, an enhancement of VEP was evident when comparing S2 with S1, with no significant effect of presentation rate. Importantly, in block-presentations, adaptation effects were statistically robust at the individual participant level. These data suggest that a more taxing block-presentation paradigm is better suited to engage visual adaptation mechanisms than a paired-presentation design. The increased sensitivity of the visual processing metric obtained in the block-paradigm has implications for the examination of visual processing deficits in clinical populations.","tags":["Visual","EEG","Adaptation"],"title":"Spatio-temporal dynamics of adaptation in the human visual system; a high-density electrical mapping study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Conor Fearon","John S Butler","Louis Newman","Timothy Lynch","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"c2b9341dc60aa47807f6506f71336e03","permalink":"/publication/2015_fearon_avsrt_pd/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_fearon_avsrt_pd/","section":"publication","summary":"Background; Sensory and perceptual disturbances are prominent in Parkinson’s PD and probably contribute to motor deficits such as bradykinesia and gait disturbances, including freezing of gait. Simple reaction time tests are a helpful way to explore sensory responses, as they require little cognitive processing. However, reaction times reflect both sensory and motor processing and thus relative differences between modalities should be examined to reflect true sensory processing taking motor delays into account. Multisensory integration is the ability of the brain to integrate sensory information from multiple modalities into a single coherent percept, which is crucial when interacting with our environment such as for complex motor output. Objectives; The goal of this study was to; 1. Assess differences in unisensory (auditory and visual) and multisensory processing speed in people with PD and age-matched healthy controls. 2. Compare relative differences in unisensory processing in people with PD with disease duration and freezing of gait status taking into account the motor delays, which are invariably present in PD. 3. Compare relative differences in multisensory (audiovisual) processing between the PD cohort and age-matched controls.Methods; 39 people with PD and 17 age-matched healthy controls performed a reaction time task in response to unisensory (auditory-alone, visual-alone) and multisensory (audiovisual) stimuli. Results; Relative unisensory differences occur in PD which are correlated with freezing of gait status and disease duration as well as multisensory processing differenes between people with PD and healthy controls.  Conclusion; There are significant unisensory and multisensory processing abnormalities in PD which are associated with disease progression. This adds to the literature supporting both simple and higher-order sensory processing abnormalities in PD.","tags":["Audio","Visual","Mulitsensory","Behavioural","Parkinson's Disease"],"title":"Audiovisual Processing is Abnormal in Parkinson’s Disease and Correlates with Freezing of Gait and Disease Duration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeannette R.

The exact hierarchical level of multisensory convergence zones and the timing of their inputs are still under debate, although increasingly, evidence points to multisensory integration (MSI) at very early sensory processing levels. While MSI is said to be governed by stimulus properties including space, time, and magnitude, violations of these rules have been documented. The objective of the current study was to determine, both psychophysically and electrophysiologically, whether differential visual-somatosensory (VS) integration patterns exist for stimuli presented to the same versus opposite hemifields. Using high-density electrical mapping and complementary psychophysical data, we examined multisensory integrative processing for combinations of visual and somatosensory inputs presented to both left and right spatial locations. We assessed how early during sensory processing VS interactions were seen in the event-related potential and whether spatial alignment of the visual and somatosensory elements resulted in differential integration effects. Reaction times to all VS pairings were significantly faster than those to the unisensory conditions, regardless of spatial alignment, pointing to engagement of integrative multisensory processing in all conditions. In support, electrophysiological results revealed significant differences between multisensory simultaneous VS and summed V + S responses, regardless of the spatial alignment of the constituent inputs. Nonetheless, multisensory effects were earlier in the aligned conditions, and were found to be particularly robust in the case of right-sided inputs (beginning at just 55 ms). In contrast to previous work on audio-visual and audio-somatosensory inputs, the current work suggests a degree of spatial specificity to the earliest detectable multisensory integrative effects in response to VS pairings.","tags":["Visual","Somatosensory","EEG","Multisensory","Aging"],"title":"Keeping in touch with the visual system: spatial alignment and multisensory integration of visual-somatosensory inputs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brenda Malcolm","John J.

This may be particularly problematic during everyday multitasking situations when cognitively demanding tasks are performed while walking. Due to previous limitations in neuroimaging technology, much remains unknown about the cortical mechanisms underlying resource allocation during locomotion. Here, we utilized an EEG-based Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) technique that integrates high-density event-related potential (ERP) recordings with simultaneously acquired foot-force sensor data to monitor gait patterns and brain activity concurrently. To assess effects of motor load on cognition we evaluated young (N=17; mean age=27.2) and older adults (N=16; mean age=63.9) and compared behavioral and ERP measures associated with performing a Go/No-Go response inhibition task as participants sat stationary or walked on a treadmill. Stride time and variability were also measured during task performance and compared to stride parameters obtained without task performance, thereby assessing effects of cognitive load on gait. Results showed that older, but not young adults’ accuracy dropped significantly when performing the inhibitory task while walking. Young adults revealed ERP modulations at relatively early (N2 amplitude reduction) and later (earlier P3 latency) stages within the processing stream as motor load increased while walking. In contrast, older adults’ ERP modulations were limited to later processing stages (increased P3 amplitude) of the inhibitory network. The relative delay and attenuation of ERP modulations accompanied by behavioral costs in older participants might indicate an age-associated loss in flexible resource allocation across multiple tasks. Better understanding of the neural underpinnings of these age-related changes may lead to improved strategies to reduce fall risk and enhance mobility in aging.","tags":["Visual","EEG","MoBI","Aging","Walking"],"title":"The aging brain shows less flexible reallocation of cognitive resources during dual-task walking: a mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saskia M Waechter","Conor Fearon","Conor McDonnell","J Gallego","Brendan Quinlivan","Isabelle Killane","John S Butler","Timothy Lynch","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435708800,"objectID":"2dd1b2c0d26653f25f37bffec1f1b604","permalink":"/publication/2015_waechteretal-ieee_neuraleng/","publishdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_waechteretal-ieee_neuraleng/","section":"publication","summary":"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common disabling gait disorder in late stage Parkinson's disease (PD), which can lead to falls and loss of independence.

Analysis of the EEG data revealed consistent visual responses to the stimuli, but an absence of the P3b component in stimulus-locked brain responses for FOG+ participants and both conditions.

Considerable work indicates oscillatory synchronization through phase alignment is a major agent of inter-regional communication. In the brain, different oscillatory phases correspond to low- and high-excitability states. Optimally aligned phases (or high-excitability states) promote inter-regional communication. Studies have also shown that sensory stimulation can modulate or reset the phase of ongoing cortical oscillations. For example, auditory stimuli can reset the phase of oscillations in visual cortex, influencing processing of a simultaneous visual stimulus. Such cross-regional phase reset represents a candidate mechanism for aligning oscillatory phase for inter-regional communication. Here, we explored the role of local and inter-regional phase alignment in driving a well established behavioral correlate of multisensory integration: the redundant target effect (RTE), which refers to the fact that responses to multisensory inputs are substantially faster than to unisensory stimuli. In a speeded detection task, human epileptic patients (N = 3) responded to unisensory (auditory or visual) and multisensory (audiovisual) stimuli with a button press, while electrocorticography was recorded over auditory and motor regions. Visual stimulation significantly modulated auditory activity via phase reset in the delta and theta bands. During the period between stimulation and subsequent motor response, transient synchronization between auditory and motor regions was observed. Phase synchrony to multisensory inputs was faster than to unisensory stimulation. This sensorimotor phase alignment correlated with behavior such that stronger synchrony was associated with faster responses, linking the commonly observed RTE with phase alignment across a sensorimotor network.","tags":["Visual","Auditory","Multisensory","Electro-corticography (ECoG)","Oscillations"],"title":"Neuro-Oscillatory Phase Alignment Drives Speeded Multisensory Response Times: An Electro-Corticographic Investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S Butler","Anna Molloy","Laura Williams","Okka Kimmich","Brendan Quinlivan","Sean O'Riordan","Michael Hutchinson","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1433116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433116800,"objectID":"68f6cc91eda48012f0d701e516010c3f","permalink":"/publication/2015_butler-et-al-tdt/","publishdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_butler-et-al-tdt/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective.

It is hypothesised that genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors may exert protective or deleterious effects on penetrance of AOPTD. By examining environmental exposure history in cervical dystonia patients and their similarly aged unaffected siblings we aimed to determine the role of previous environmental exposures in relation to disease penetrance. Methods A case-control study of 67 patients with cervical dystonia and 67 of their age-matched unaffected siblings was performed. Past environmental exposures were assessed using a detailed 124-question standardised questionnaire. Results By univariate analysis, cervical dystonia patients, compared to their unaffected siblings, had an increased frequency of a history of car accidents with hospital attendance (OR 10.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 47.4, p=0.004) and surgical episodes (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.76 to 23.61, p=0.005).

When incongruent auditory and visual information is presented concurrently, it can hinder a listener’s perception and even cause him or her to perceive information that was not presented in either modality. Efforts to investigate the neural basis of these effects have often focused on the special case of discrete audiovisual syllables that are spatially and temporally congruent, with less work done on the case of natural, continuous speech. Recent electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that cortical response measures to continuous auditory speech can be easily obtained using multivariate analysis methods. Here, we apply such methods to the case of audiovisual speech and, importantly, present a novel framework for indexing multisensory integration in the context of continuous speech. Specifically, we examine how the temporal and contextual congruency of ongoing audiovisual speech affects the cortical encoding of the speech envelope in humans using electro- encephalography. We demonstrate that the cortical representation of the speech envelope is enhanced by the presentation of congruent audiovisual speech in noise-free conditions. Furthermore, we show that this is likely attributable to the contribution of neural generators that are not particularly active during unimodal stimulation and that it is most prominent at the temporal scale corresponding to syllabic rate (2– 6 Hz). Finally, our data suggest that neural entrainment to the speech envelope is inhibited when the auditory and visual streams are incongruent both temporally and contextually.","tags":["Visual","Auditory","EEG","Multisensory","Stimulus reconstruction","Speech"],"title":"Congruent Visual Speech Enhances Cortical Entrainment to Continuous Auditory Speech in Noise-Free Conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Williams","John S Butler","Anna Molloy","Eavan McGovern","Ines Beiser","Okka Kimmich","Brendan Quinlivan","Sean O'Riordan","Michael Hutchinson","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d0ec728ace8005cc52411ef710f92e56","permalink":"/publication/2015_williams-gender-dimorphism/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_williams-gender-dimorphism/","section":"publication","summary":"The temporal discrimination threshold (TDT) is the shortest time interval at which two sensory stimuli presented sequentially are detected as asynchronous by the observer.

A wealth of previous research in the field of multisensory integration has shown that if different sensory signals are spatially or temporally discrepant, they may not combine in a statistically optimal fashion; however, this has not been well explored for visual–vestibular integration. Self-motion perception involves the integration of various movement parameters including displacement, velocity, acceleration and higher derivatives such as jerk. It is often assumed that the vestibular system is optimized for the processing of acceleration and higher derivatives, while the visual system is specialized to process position and velocity. In order to determine the interactions between different spatiotemporal properties for self-motion perception, in Experiment 1 we first asked whether the velocity profile of a visual trajectory affects discrimination performance in a heading task. Participants performed a two-interval forced choice heading task while stationary. They were asked to make heading discriminations while the visual stimulus moved at a constant velocity (C-Vis) or with a raised cosine velocity (R-Vis) motion profile. Experiment 2 was designed to assess how the visual and vestibular velocity profiles combined during the same heading task. In this case, participants were seated on a Stewart motion platform and motion information was presented via visual information alone, vestibular information alone or both cues combined. The combined condition consisted of congruent blocks (R-Vis/R-Vest) in which both visual and vestibular cues consisted of a raised cosine velocity profile and incongruent blocks (C-Vis/R-Vest) in which the visual motion profile consisted of a constant velocity motion, while the vestibular motion consisted of a raised cosine velocity profile. Results from both Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that visual heading estimates are indeed affected by the velocity profile of the movement trajectory, with lower thresholds observed for the R-Vis compared to the C-Vis. In Exp. 2 when visual–vestibularinputs were both present, they were combined in a statistically optimal fashion irrespective of the type of visual velocity profile, thus demonstrating robust integration of visual and vestibular cues. The study suggests that while the time course of the velocity did affect visual heading judgments, a moderate conflict between visual and vestibular motion profiles does not cause a breakdown in optimal integration for heading.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory"],"title":"Optimal visual–vestibular integration under conditions of conflicting intersensory motion profiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gizely N Andrade","Sophie Molholm","Alice B Brandwien","John S Butler","Steve U Walkley","John J Foxe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409529600,"objectID":"174a4fdeab3faf7021829d86d4fc8eef","permalink":"/publication/2014_andradeetal2014_npc_avsrt/","publishdate":"2014-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_andradeetal2014_npc_avsrt/","section":"publication","summary":"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disease in which cholesterol and glycosphingolipids accumulate in lysosomes due to aberrant cell-transport mechanisms.

A simple way to test integrity of the multisensory system is to ask whether individuals respond faster to the occurrence of a bisensory event than they do to the occurrence of either of the unisensory constituents alone. Here, we presented simple auditory, visual, and audio-visual stimuli in random sequence. Participants responded as fast as possible with a button push. One 11-year-old and two 14-year-old boys with NPC participated in the experiment and their results were compared to those of 35 age-matched neurotypical boys. Reaction times (RTs) to the stimuli when presented simultaneously were significantly faster than when they were presented alone in the neurotypical children, a facilitation that could not be accounted for by probability summation, as evidenced by violation of the so-called ‘race’ model. In stark contrast, the NPC boys showed no such speeding, despite the fact that their unisensory RTs fell within the distribution of RTs observed in the neurotypicals. These results uncover a previously undescribed deficit in multisensory integrative abilities in NPC, with implications for ongoing treatment of the clinical symptoms of these children. They also suggest that multisensory processes may represent a good candidate biomarker against which to test the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.","tags":["Audio","Visual","Multisensory","Niemann-Pick type C disease","Behavioural"],"title":"Atypical multisensory integration in Niemann-Pick type C disease – towards potential biomarkers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alice B.

We applied an EEG-based Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MOBI) system that integrates high-density event-related potential (ERP) recordings with simultaneously acquired foot-force sensor data to monitor gait patterns and brain activity. We compared behavioral and ERP measures associated with performing a Go/NoGo response-inhibition task under conditions where participants (N=18) sat stationary, walked deliberately or walked briskly. This allowed for assessment of effects of increasing dual-task load (i.e. walking speed) on neural indices of inhibitory control. Stride time and variability were also measured during inhibitory task performance and compared to stride parameters without task performance, thereby assessing reciprocal dual-task effects on gait parameters. There were no task performance differences between sitting and either walking condition, indicating that participants could perform both tasks simultaneously without suffering dual-task costs. However, participants took longer strides under dual-task load, likely indicating an adaptive mechanism to reduce inter-task competition for cortical resources. We found robust differences in amplitude, latency and topography of ERP components (N2 and P3) associated with inhibitory control between the sitting and walking conditions. Considering that participants showed no dual-task performance costs, we suggest that observed neural alterations under increasing task-load represent adaptive recalibration of the inhibitory network towards a more controlled and effortful processing mode, thereby optimizing performance under dual-task situations","tags":["Visual","EEG","Self-motion","Multisensory","Walking","MoBI"],"title":"Recalibration of inhibitory control systems during walking-related dual-task interference: A Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MOBI) Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Hutchinson","Tadashi Isa","Anna Molloy","Okka Kimmich","Laura Williams","Fiona Molloy","Helena Moore","Daniel G Healy","Tim Lynch","Cathal Walsh","John S Butler","Richard B Reilly","Richard Walsh","Sean O’Riordan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1396310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1396310400,"objectID":"8aca43b59721422d586538bee63de266","permalink":"/publication/2014-hutchinson-concept-2014/","publishdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-hutchinson-concept-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"While the pathogenesis of cervical dystonia remains unknown, recent animal and clinical experimental studies have indicated its probable mechanisms. Abnormal temporal discrim- ination is a mediational endophenotype of cervical dystonia and informs new concepts of disease pathogenesis. Our hypothesis is that both abnormal temporal discrimination and cervical dystonia are due to a disorder of the midbrain network for covert attentional orient- ing caused by reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition, resulting, in turn, from as yet undetermined, genetic mutations. Such disinhibition is (a) subclinically manifested by abnormal temporal discrimination due to prolonged duration firing of the visual sensory neurons in the superficial laminae of the superior colliculus and (b) clinically manifested by cervical dystonia due to disinhibited burst activity of the cephalomotor neurons of the inter- mediate and deep laminae of the superior colliculus. Abnormal temporal discrimination in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with cervical dystonia represents a subclinical manifestation of defective GABA activity both within the superior colliculus and from the substantia nigra pars reticulata.

We devised a portable headset method for visual temporal discrimination determination and our aim was to validate this portable tool against the traditional laboratory-based method in a group of patients and in a large cohort of healthy controls.\nMethods\nVisual TDTs were examined in two groups 1) in 96 healthy control participants divided by age and gender, and 2) in 33 cervical dystonia patients, using two methods of data acquisition, the traditional table-top laboratory-based system, and the novel portable headset method. The order of assessment was randomized in the control group. The results obtained by each technique were compared.\nResults\nVisual temporal discrimination in healthy control participants demonstrated similar age and gender effects by the headset method as found by the table-top examination. There were no significant differences between visual TDTs obtained using the two methods, both for the control participants and for the cervical dystonia patients. Bland–Altman testing showed good concordance between the two methods in both patients and in controls.\nDiscussion\nThe portable headset device is a reliable and accurate method for visual temporal discrimination testing for use outside the laboratory, and will facilitate increased TDT data collection outside of the hospital setting. This is of particular importance in multiplex families where data collection in all available members of the pedigree is important for exome sequencing studies.","tags":["Dystonia","Temporal Discrimination Threshold"],"title":"A headset method for measuring the visual temporal discrimination threshold in cervical dystonia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ted S Altschuler","Sophie Molholm","John S Butler","Manuel R Mercier","Alice B Brandwein","John J Foxe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"bc46ef56b1ba99b2bd15207c761d7330","permalink":"/publication/2014_altschuler-et-al/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_altschuler-et-al/","section":"publication","summary":"The adult human visual system can efficiently fill-in missing object boundaries when low-level information from the retina is incomplete, but little is known about how these processes develop across childhood.

The data reveal that phase-detection relationships at higher frequencies are dependent on the phase of lower frequencies, such that higher frequencies alternate between periods when their phase is either strongly or weakly predictive of visual-target detection. Moreover, the specific higher frequencies and scalp topographies linked to visual-target detection also alternate as a function of lower-frequency phase.

Psychophysical studies have shown that manipulating frequency in audition or touch can have a significant cross-sensory impact on perceived frequency in the other sensory system, pointing to intimate links between these senses during computation of frequency. In this regard, the frequency of a vibratory event can be thought of as a multisensory perceptual construct. In turn, electrophysiological studies point to temporally early multisensory interactions that occur in hierarchically early sensory regions where convergent inputs from the auditory and somatosen- sory systems are to be found. A key question pertains to the level of processing at which the multisensory integration of featural information, such as frequency, occurs. Do the sensory systems calculate frequency independently before this information is combined, or is this feature calculated in an integrated fashion during preattentive sensory processing? The well characterized mismatch negativity, an electrophysiological response that indexes preattentive detection of a change within the context of a regular pattern of stimulation, served as our dependent measure. High-density electrophysiological recordings were made in humans while they were presented with separate blocks of somatosensory, auditory, and audio-somatosensory “standards” and “deviants,” where the deviant differed in fre- quency. Multisensory effects were identified beginning at 200 ms, with the multisensory mismatch negativity (MMN) significantly different from the sum of the unisensory MMNs. This provides compelling evidence for preattentive coupling between the somatosensory and auditory channels in the cortical representation of frequency.","tags":["Somatosensory","Auditory","EEG","Multisensory","Intracranial"],"title":"Multisensory Representation of Frequency across Audition and Touch; High Density Electrical Mapping Reveals Early Sensory-Perceptual Coupling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer L Campos","John S Butler","Heinrich H Bülthoff"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1346457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1346457600,"objectID":"8eeb8847c2b40214288748918fd02447","permalink":"/publication/2012_camposbutlerbulthoff_ebr_2012/","publishdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_camposbutlerbulthoff_ebr_2012/","section":"publication","summary":"When walking through space, both dynamic visual information (optic flow) and body-based information (proprioceptive and vestibular) jointly specify the magnitude of distance travelled. While recent evidence has demonstrated the extent to which each of these cues can be used independently, less is known about how they are integrated when simultaneously present. Many studies have shown that sensory information is integrated using a weighted linear sum, yet little is known about whether this holds true for the integration of visual and body-based cues for travelled distance perception. In this study using Virtual Reality technologies, participants first travelled a predefined distance and subsequently matched this distance by adjusting an egocentric, in-depth target. The visual stimulus consisted of a long hallway and was presented in stereo via a head-mounted display. Body-based cues were provided either by walking in a fully tracked free-walking space (Exp. 1) or by being passively moved in a wheelchair (Exp. 2). Travelled distances were provided either through optic flow alone, body-based cues alone or through both cues combined. In the combined condition, visually specified distances were either congruent (1.09) or incongruent (0.79 or 1.49) with distances specified by body-based cues. Responses reflect a consistent combined effect of both visual and body-based information, with an overall higher influence of body-based cues when walking and a higher influence of visual cues during passive movement. When comparing the results of Experiments 1 and 2, it is clear that both proprioceptive and vestibular cues contribute to travelled distance estimates during walking. These observed results were effectively described using a basic linear weighting model.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory","Walking"],"title":"Multisensory integration in the estimation of walked distances","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pierfilippo De Sanctis","John S Butler","Jason M.

In this study, high-density electroencephalographic recordings were deployed to investigate the neural processes associated with vestibular detection of changes in heading. To this end, a self-motion oddball paradigm was designed. Participants were translated linearly 7.8 cm on a motion platform using a one second motion profile, at a 45° angle leftward or rightward of straight ahead. These headings were presented with a stimulus probability of 80–20 %. Participants responded when they detected the infrequent direction change via button-press. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated in response to the standard (80 %) and target (20 %) movement directions. Statistical parametric mapping showed that ERPs to standard and target movements differed significantly from 490 to 950 ms post-stimulus. Topographic analysis showed that this difference had a typical P3 topography. Individual participant bootstrap analysis revealed that 93.3 % of participants exhibited a clear P3 component. These results indicate that a perceived change in vestibular heading can readily elicit a P3 response, wholly similar to that evoked by oddball stimuli presented in other sensory modalities. This vestibular-evoked P3 response may provide a readily and robustly detectable objective measure for the evaluation of vestibular integrity in various disease models.","tags":["Vestibular","EEG","P3","Oddball","Self Motion"],"title":"Neural correlates of oddball detection in self-motion heading: a high-density event-related potential study of vestibular integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alice B.

To assess the integrity of basic AV integration, we recorded high-density electrophysiology from a cohort of highfunctioning children with ASD (7–16 years) while they performed a simple AV reaction time task. Children with ASD showed considerably less behavioral facilitation to multisensory inputs, deficits that were paralleled by less effective neural integration.

Therefore, the current experiment evaluated whether presenting optic flow stimuli stereoscopically, or presenting both eyes with the same image (binocularly) affects combined visual– vestibular heading estimates. Participants performed a two-interval forced-choice task in which they were asked which of two presented movements was more rightward. They were presented with either visual cues alone, vestibular cues alone or both cues combined. Measures of reliability were obtained for both binocular and stereoscopic conditions. Group level analyses demonstrated that when stereoscopic information was available there was clear evidence of optimal integration, yet when only binocular information was available weaker evidence of cue integration was observed. Exploratory individual analyses demonstrated that for the stereoscopic condition 90% of participants exhibited optimal integration, whereas for the binocular condition only 60% of participants exhibited results consistent with optimal integration. Overall, these findings suggest that stereo vision may be important for self-motion perception, particularly under combined visual–vestibular conditions.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory","Bayesian"],"title":"The Role of Stereo Vision in Visual–Vestibular Integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Nolan","Robert Whelan","Richard B.

Thus, these properties can be said to be sensory-independent or amodal.Akey question is whethercommonmultisensory cortical regions process these amodal features, or does each sensory system contain its own specialized region(s) for processing common features? We tackled this issue by investigating simple duration-detection mechanisms across audition and touch; these systems were chosen because fine duration discriminations are possible in both. The mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the human event-related potential provides a sensitive metric of duration processing and has been elicited independently during both auditory and somatosensory investigations. Employing high-density electroencephalographic recordings in conjunction with intracranial subdural recordings, we asked whether fine duration discriminations, represented by the MMN, were generated in the same cortical regions regardless of the sensory modality being probed. Scalp recordings pointed to statistically distinct MMN topographies across senses, implying differential underlying cortical generator configurations. Intracranial recordings confirmed these noninvasive findings, showing generators of the auditoryMMN along the superior temporal gyrus with no evidence of a somatosensoryMMNin this region, whereas a robust somatosensory MMN was recorded from postcentral gyrus in the absence of an auditoryMMN.The current data clearly argue against a common circuitry account for amodal duration processing.","tags":["Somatosensory","Auditory","EEG","Multisensory","Intracranial"],"title":"Common or Redundant Neural Circuits for Duration Processing across Audition and Touch","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ian C.

Here, we tested behavioral predictions stemming from the neurophysiologic and neuroanatomic literature. Participants detected nearthreshold visual targets presented either at central fixation or peripheral to central fixation that were sometimes paired with sounds that originated from widely misaligned locations (up to 104 degrees  from the visual target). Our results demonstrate that co-occurring sounds improve the likelihood of visual-target detection (1) regardless of retinal eccentricity and (2) despite wide audiovisual misalignments. With regard to the first point, these findings suggest that auditory facilitation of visual-target detection is unlikely to operate through previously described corticocortical pathways from auditory cortex that predominantly terminate in regions of visual cortex that process peripheral visual space. With regard to the second point, auditory facilitation of visual-target detection seems to operate through a spatially non-specific modulation of visualprocessing.","tags":["Audio","Visual","Multisensory","Behavioural"],"title":"Auditory facilitation of visual-target detection persists regardless of retinal eccentricity and despite wide audiovisual misalignments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S Butler","Stuart T Smith","Jennifer L Campos","Heinrich H Bülthoff"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1283299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1283299200,"objectID":"447c040305cf2f57114851327fcb2951","permalink":"/publication/2010_journalofvision/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010_journalofvision/","section":"publication","summary":"Self-motion through an environment involves a composite of signals such as visual and vestibular cues. Building upon previous results showing that visual and vestibular signals combine in a statistically optimal fashion, we investigated the relative weights of visual and vestibular cues during  self motion.  This experiment is comprised of three experimental conditions; vestibular alone, visual alone (with four different standard heading values) and visual-vestibular combined. In the combined cue condition, inter-sensory conflicts were introduced (Δ=±6°or ±10°). Participants performed a 2-interval forced choice task in all conditions and were asked to judge “in which of the two intervals did you move more to the right”. The cue-conflict condition revealed the relative weights associated with each modality. We found that even when there was a relatively large conflict between the visual and vestibular cues, participants exhibited a statistically optimal reduction in variance. On the other hand, we found that the pattern of results in the unimodal conditions did not predict the weights in the combined cue condition. Specifically, visual-vestibular cue combination was not predicted solely by the reliability of each cue, but rather more weight was given to the vestibular cue.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory","Bayesian"],"title":"Bayesian integration of visual and vestibular signals for heading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer L Campos","John S Butler","Heinrich H Bülthoff"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1283299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1283299200,"objectID":"e0d7464fc830114aae330b692d6d4e3e","permalink":"/publication/2014_camposetal2014/","publishdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_camposetal2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent research has provided evidence that visual and body-based cues (vestibular, proprioceptive and efference copy) are integrated using a weighted linear sum during walking and passive transport. However, little is known about the specific weighting of visual information when combined with proprioceptive inputs alone, in the absence of vestibular information about forward selfmotion. Therefore, in this study, participants walked in place on a stationary treadmill while dynamic visual information was updated in real time via a head-mounted display. The task required participants to travel a predefined distance and subsequently match this distance by adjusting an egocentric, in-depth target using a game controller.Travelled distance information was provided either throughvisual cues alone, proprioceptive cues alone or both cues combined. In the combined cue condition, the relationship between the two cues was manipulated by either changing the visual gain across trials (0.7×, 1.0×, 1.4×; Exp. 1) orthe proprioceptive gain across trials (0.7×, 1.0×, 1.4×; Exp. 2). Results demonstrated an overall higher weighting of proprioception over vision. These weights were scaled, however, as a function of which sensory input provided more stable information across trials. Specifically, when visual gain was constantly manipulated, proprioceptive weights were higher than when proprioceptive gain was constantly manipulated. These results therefore reveal interesting characteristics of cue-weighting within the context of unfolding spatio-temporal cue dynamics.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory"],"title":"Contributions of visual and proprioceptive information to travelled distance estimation during changing sensory congruencies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Soyka","Harold Teufel","Karl Beykirch","Paolo Robuffo-Giordano","John S Butler","Frank M Nieuwenhuizen","Heinrich H Bülthoff"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1251763200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1251763200,"objectID":"5d2fc657f74120c8d8a476cb52c2e889","permalink":"/publication/2009_soykaetal2009_jerk/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2009_soykaetal2009_jerk/","section":"publication","summary":"Perceptual thresholds for the detection of the direction of linear motion are important for motion simulation. There are situations in which a subject should not perceive the motion direction as, e.g., during repositioning of a simulator, but also opposite cases where a certain motion percept must intentionally be induced in the subject. The exact dependency of the perceptual thresholds on the time evolution of the presented motion profile is still an open question. Previous studies have found evidence for a sensitivity of the thresholds on the rate of change of acceleration, called jerk. In this study we investigate three motion profiles which differ in their jerk characteristics.

Our goal was to investigate the visual and vestibular cues to the direction of linear self-motion (heading direction). In the vestibular experiment, blindfolded participants were given two distinct forward linear translations, using a Stewart Platform, with identical acceleration profiles. One motion was a standard heading direction, while the test heading was randomly varied using the method of constant stimuli. The participants judged in which interval they moved further towards the right. In the visual-alone condition, participants were presented with two intervals of radial optic flow stimuli and judged which of the two intervals represented a pattern of optic flow consistent with more rightward self-motion. From participants’ responses, we compute psychometric functions for both experiments, from which we can calculate the participant’s uncertainty in heading direction

Neuroscience Engineering Physics Biology Football Computer Games Animation Nature    Predator Prey Predators and prey The cyclical relationship of Predators and Prey in the wild means that when there is an abundance of prey, the predators will eat more and the prey population will increase. On the other hand, if there is a shortage in the number of prey, the number of predators will decrease due to the scarcity of food sources [1-4].\n# INITIAL CONDITIONS N=1000000 h=0.01 time = np.arange(1950, 2100, h ) # time N=len(time) plant=80*np.ones(N) # 60 billions small plant deer=45*np.ones(N) # 30 billion deer SMALLplant = np.array( [0.9,-0.02,0.03]) deer_constant= np.array([0.005,0.002,-0.001]) for i in range (1,N): plant[i]=plant[i-1]+h*plant[i-1]*(SMALLplant[0]+SMALLplant[1]*deer[i-1]) deer[i]=deer[i-1]+h*deer[i-1]*(deer_constant[0]+deer_constant[1]*(plant[i-1]-40))   Deers The plot below shows the deer (blue) population as a function of time over 150 years.\nwith plt.xkcd(): ## PLOTTING fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,4)) plt.plot(time, deer, 'b-', label='deer',linewidth=3) plt.grid() plt.xlabel('time (years)') plt.ylabel('Population (hundreds)') plt.legend(loc='best') plt.tight_layout() plt.ylim([0,120]) # plt.savefig('deer_Hand.png', bbox_inches='tight',dpi=300) plt.show() png\n The deer population goes up and down on a year by year basis.\n What do deers eat?
