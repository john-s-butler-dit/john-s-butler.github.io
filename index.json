The workshop was divided into two parts. Part 1: Modelling Predator-Prey Relationships  In the first part, students learned how graphs and maths can be used to model predator-prey relationships, such as lynxes and hares (Figure 1) or even people and social media. The maths not only recreated observations in the wild, but also modelled changes in the environment, such as the reintroduction of wolves into Ireland. Part 2: How Maths and Neuroscience Inspire Machine Learning  In the second part, I explained how machine learning algorithms are inspired by maths and neuroscience. Students learned how to model decision-making, such as choosing to turn left or right. These same models have since been adapted to create self-driving cars.

Our focus? Using comedy to communicate neuroscience.  On day one, we ran a packed workshop with 50 participants. We shared our experiences in comedy science communication, explored how humor can bring science to life, and encouraged participants to turn their research into something funny or absurd. In small groups, they sketched out routines, with us offering guidance and feedback. The energy was incredible, and many signed up to perform the next day.  Day two saw 14 brave neuroscientists debut 10 comedy acts‚Äîcovering everything from child development to single-cell research, mouse experiments, and even the absurdity of poster sessions. Performances ranged from classic stand-up to two-person acts and a comedy troupe. Over 250 people filled the room, and every act earned big laughs and warm applause.

It had the goal to identify regions of the language network showing multisensory enhancement under synchronous audiovisual conditions. We expected this enhancement to emerge in regions known to underlie the integration of auditory and visual information such as the posterior superior temporal gyrus as well as parts of the broader language network, including the semantic system. To this end we presented 53 participants with a continuous narration of a story in auditory alone, visual alone, and both synchronous and asynchronous audiovisual speech conditions while recording brain activity using BOLD fMRI. We found multisensory enhancement in an extensive network of regions underlying multisensory integration and parts of the semantic network as well as extralinguistic regions not usually associated with multisensory integration, namely the primary visual cortex and the bilateral amygdala. Analysis also revealed involvement of thalamic brain regions along the visual and auditory pathways more commonly associated with early sensory processing. We conclude that under natural listening conditions, multisensory enhancement not only involves sites of multisensory integration but many regions of the wider semantic network and includes regions associated with extralinguistic sensory, perceptual and cognitive processing.

Data from the Gutenberg Health Survey was digitized to allow comparison of a representative, population-based sample with the spectacle lens sales data. A bootstrap analysis was completed to assess the comparability of both datasets. The expected level of vision impairment resulting from myopia at 75 years of age was calculated for both datasets using a previously published risk estimation equation combined with a saturation function.\nMain Outcome Measures: Comparability of spectacle lens sales data on refractive error with typical population surveys of refractive error and its potential usefulness to predict vision impairment resulting from refractive error.\nResults: Equivalent estimates of the population distribution of spherical equivalent refraction can be provided from spectacle lens data within limits. For myopia, the population distribution was equivalent to the Gutenberg Health Survey (‚â§ 5% deviation) for levels of ‚Äì2.0 diopters (D) or less, whereas for hyperopia, the distribution was equivalent (‚â§ 5% deviation) for levels of +3.0 D or more. The estimated rates of vision impairment resulting from myopia were not statistically significantly different (chi-square, 182; degrees of freedom, 169; P = 0.234) between the spectacle lens dataset and Gutenberg Health Survey dataset.\nConclusions: The distribution of refractive error and hence the risk of vision impairment resulting from refractive error within a population can be determined using spectacle lens sales data. Pooling this type of data from multiple industry sources could provide a cost-effective, timely, and globally representative mechanism for monitoring the evolving epidemiologic features of refractive error and associated vision impairment.","tags":["Optometry"],"title":"The refractive error and vision impairment estimation with spectacle data study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S Butler"],"categories":null,"content":"I wrote a blog for @BrightClubIRL on why \u0026quot;Maths is a Joke\u0026quot;.\nI really believe that maths and comedy are two sides of the same coin hopefully this will convince you that both are all about context.#SciComm https://t.co/nxnY87RiW0\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) January 31, 2022  ","date":1643760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643760000,"objectID":"b8ebeb49a10bc82c7fe29527fdc78b3c","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/2022brightclubblog/","publishdate":"2022-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022brightclubblog/","section":"talk","summary":"Bright Club Dublin Blog.","tags":["Outreach","Comedy"],"title":"The Comedy of Mathematics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Michael Moore","John S Butler","Daniel I Flitcroft","James Loughman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643068800,"objectID":"7fd1c2540ce2e46011da452ada049269","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2022_moorebigdata/","publishdate":"2022-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_moorebigdata/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose Visual acuity (VA) assessment is the most commonly performed vision screening method for drivers.

Design Double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the European Nutrition in Glaucoma Management Study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04460365). Participants Sixty-two participants (38 men, 24 women) with a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma were enrolled. Forty-two were randomized to receive the active supplement, 20 participants were allocated to placebo. Methods Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) was measured by autofluorescence using the Heidelberg Spectralis scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Macular pigment optical density volume within the central 6¬∞ of retinal eccentricity as well as MPOD at 0.23¬∞, 0.51¬∞, 0.74¬∞, and 1.02¬∞ were recorded at baseline and at 6-month intervals over 18 months. Visual function was assessed using visual acuity, mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity under glare conditions, photo stress recovery time, microperimetry, and Glaucoma Activities Limitation 9 questionnaire. Advanced glaucoma module scans of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and ganglion cell complex thickness over the central 6¬∞ of retinal eccentricity also were completed at each study visit. Main Outcome Measures Change in MPOD after supplementation with 10 mg lutein, 2 mg zeaxanthin, and 10 mg meso-zeaxanthin or placebo over 18 months. Results A mixed-model repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant increase in MPOD volume (significant time effect: F(3,111) = 89.31, mean square error (MSE) = 1656.9; P 0.05 for all). A statistically significant increase in mesopic contrast sensitivity under glare conditions was noted at 18 months in the treatment group, but not placebo. No other structural or functional changes were observed. No serious adverse events were noted during the trial. Conclusions Macular pigment can be augmented in glaucomatous eyes by supplementation with a formulation containing the carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin. The greatest relative benefit was observed in those with the lowest baseline levels, but increases were noted across all participants and each retinal eccentricity. The potential benefits of MP augmentation for macular health in glaucoma merit further long-term evaluation.","tags":["Optometry","Macular Pigment","Myopia"],"title":"Macular Pigment Response to Lutein, Zeaxanthin, and Meso-zeaxanthin Supplementation in Open-Angle Glaucoma: A Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"The Music of Neuromatch Neuromatch Neuromatch Academy is a phenomenal organisation which has changed the way people think about teaching online that I‚Äôve had the privilege to been a part of the last two summers. You can read about the inception and running of the Neuromatch Academy summer school in this very interesting and informative blog by blog by Gunnar Blohm. Or you can read about the dramatic last minute ban of Iranian students and TAs in 2020 due to some US sanctions and then even more dramatic laster minute lift of the ban. Or you can read the paper about how Neuromatch has championed global accessibility. Neuromatch Academy 2021 was particularly significant for me as I created some of the course content and made the concept maps with the help of my 7 year old daughter. The process of writing material for Neuromatch is very edifying. I had the pleasure of discussing content materials with other content creators (Ella Batty, Arvind Kumar and Ulrik Beierholm) before and while writing the tutorials, as well as getting feedback from pre-pod teaching assistants before the tutorials were released. After all that there was a post-production team that made sure everything worked and edited and subtitled the videos. As someone who enjoys teaching, rarely have I had the time or resources to have a team to help develop the materials so this was a highlight of my teaching year and perhaps a high point of my 20+ years of teaching. The Neuromatch materials are excellent and accessible to everyone across all time zones, so the next barrier to learning is ensuring that the students feel they can ask questions. A solution to this happened organically. Some of the volunteers were so invested in the materials they made playlists, tribute songs and comedy routines. None of this trivialized the content but were an Ode to the Joy of the materials. While these tributes might not directly impact the learning outcomes they created a more convivial learning atmosphere for the students, which can only be a good thing. Here, I will write about the link between music and Neuromatch and why I made playlists for the Neuromatch summer schools.  Music and Teaching  I began playing songs in lectures when due to COVID-19 we were forced to move to remote teaching. I felt that the start of every online lecture was very abrupt and to be honest I felt awkward as the only person with their camera on. Normally, with in person lectures I would begin by chatting about different things to help the students relax and encourage engagement. This was not possible in an online setting as for a multitude of different reasons most students could not turn on their cameras or microphones. I wanted to find a way to reduce both my own and their awkwardness and encourage engagement, so I decided to start every class with a song that had some link to the lecture content. The songs acted as a sound check for the students and as an ice-breaker and change of pace for everyone. During the monotony and exhaustion of teaching online, picking songs that would have some relevance to the materials was both fun and challenging. The songs ranged from classical to pop to rock to jazz. For example, I picked the excellent ‚ÄúZombie‚Äù by Fela Kuti to motivate a lecture on predator-prey models, and I was enjoying the song so much that I started dad chair-dancing along with my camera on, which I hope made everyone feel embarrassed but also feel a bit more at ease. I choose to play Zombie by Fela Kuti at the start of the predator prey lecture which was pretty cool so I half-chair danced along because it is a great song, which was embarrassing for everyone. Once again, I nailed my peak \u0026quot;cool\u0026quot; dad maths lecturer status. https://t.co/16JIbjF4Nw pic.twitter.com/XjyHr56MPl\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) March 16, 2021  Other examples included picking ‚ÄúSisyphus‚Äù by Andrew Bird to illustrate that most Numerical Methods are repeating the same thing again and again like rolling a rock up a hill. The most kudos I received for a song choice was when I played ‚ÄúThe Boys In The Better Land‚Äù by Fontaines DC, which was not relevant to the lecture but the band had just been nominated for a Grammy. Overall, the student reaction was positive, maybe not about all the song choices, but they responded well to the rational, and it generated some chat and added variety to the day. Now to Neuromatch playlists.\nThe Neuromatch Playlists As Neuromatch Academy in 2021 was massive with almost 5000 students from over 100 countries split between the computational neuroscience summer school and the deep learning summer school. Finding a link with the other members of neuromatch can seem daunting. The student engamement team did an excellent job organising events and even having a Neuromatch Academy's Got Talent which included musical, comedy, art and t-shirt design competitions. So to contribute in a small way I made two playlist one for each Neuromatch summer school with the lofty goals: Neuromatch Academy in 2021 had almost 5000 students from over 100 countries split between the Computational Neuroscience Summer School (June 30th-July 23rd, 2021) and the Deep Learning Summer School (August 2nd -August 23rd, 2021). So finding a link with the other members of Neuromatch and the materials could seem daunting. The student engagement team did an excellent job organising events such as a Neuromatch Academy‚Äôs got talent including a music, comedy, art and t-shirt design competitions. To contribute in a small way I made two playlists one for each Neuromatch Summer School with the lofty goals:   as a tribute the amazing course materials,   to add some levity to the learning experience,  to hopefully help some students make a connect to each other and the materials,  to encourage myself to look at all the materials,  lastly, as a thank you to all the people involved in organising Neuromatch Academy.   Computational Neuroscience Playlist Computational Neuroscience Summer School started with a Python refresher which I paired it with ‚ÄúHolst: The Planets‚Äù. In particular the song ‚ÄúJupyter: the Bringer of Joy‚Äù, which in my mind is the unofficial anthem of Computational Neuroscience Neuromatch as I believe Neuromatch is the Bringer of Joy to many students. To give a sample of the songs and the links, I picked ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Give Up‚Äù Peter Gabriel \u0026amp; Kate Bush for the Dynamical Systems day to illustrate that the modelling of inhibition and excitation is like a beautiful duet between two equations. Also, this is the midpoint of the materials which can be a daunting moment for the students, so I figured the sentiment of the song seemed relevant:\n üé∂‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up now\nWe‚Äôre proud of who you are\nDon‚Äôt give up\nYou know it‚Äôs never been easy.‚Äùüé∂\n Here is the complete tweet thread for choosing each song and my motivation for the Computational Neuroscience Summer School\n@neuromatch starts tomorrow with a Python refresher.\nI‚Äôm going to give a musical pairing for each day.\nFor W0D1 my suggestion is Holst: The Planets.\nIn particular, Jupyter: the Bringer of Joy.\nBest of luck to all the students and TAs I hope it brings joy\nhttps://t.co/gC6Vdgpfmg\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) June 27, 2021  and the corresponding Computational Neuroscience Summer School Spotify playlist:  Deep Learning Playlist This is the first year of the Deep Learning  summer school. So I figured the unofficial anthem would be the adapted song lyrics from \"In Too Deep\" by Sum 41 which might be a window into the minds of how some of the organisers and students: This is the first year of the Deep Learning Neuromatch Summer School. I started with ‚ÄúRolling in the Deep‚Äù by Adele as the students were straight into the deep with the basics and Pytorch. On the Optimization day I paired ‚ÄúIn too Deep‚Äù by Sum 41 which might have been a window into the minds of how some of the organisers and students were feeling:  üé∂\"'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep\nUp above in my head, instead of going under\"\nInstead of going under I did neuromatch DL.üé∂  Hopefully, this provided some reassurance to all students that there are moments when we all feel like we are in too deep when learning something new but have trust the process. Here is the full Deep Learning tweet thread with the details of the sometimes tenuous motivation of why I picked each song: Here is my full playlist for @neuromatch Deep Learning.\nMy song for Basics And Pytorch (W1D1) by Shubh Pachchigar, @haltakov , Matthew Sargent, @KordingLab is\n‚ÄúRolling in the Deep‚Äù by Adele\n1/16https://t.co/BbzxkJdVz4\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) August 3, 2021  and the corresponding Spotify Deep Learning Summer School playlist:  Musical Tribute On the last day of the Deep Learning course, as part of the music competition, Megan Peters (Chairperson of Neuromatch) knocked the musical tributes to Neuromatch out of the park with her amazing song inspired by The Bee Gees ‚ÄúHow Deep is Your Love?‚Äù and a small suggestion from Gunnar Blohm. Megan rewrote the song as ‚ÄúHow Deep Can You Learn?‚Äù. Megan‚Äôs includes brilliant lyrics such as:  üé∂‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living in a neural net, optimizing‚Ä¶. When we all should generalise!‚Äùüé∂  It is a true musical and Deep Learning genius and I believe it should be the Neuromatch Deep Learning anthem.  Ode to Joy  For myself, making the playlists was enjoyable, I found some new music, and I read the course materials. I will be dipping back into them both again and again and again as they are excellent songs and materials. The songs and their links to the materials generated a bit of discussion on twitter and on the summer schools discord music channels, which was nice. Finally, I hope that when people listen to the playlists they know it as a grateful thank you from me to the students, the TAs, the volunteers and the board of Neuromatch. My final musical parings for @neuromatch are:\n\u0026quot;You\u0026#39;re Welcome\u0026quot; form Moana,\n\u0026quot;Danke Sch√∂n\u0026quot; by Wayne Newton\n\u0026quot;Ode to Joy\u0026quot; by Beethoven\nNeuromatch has been a highlight of my year so you\u0026#39;re welcomeüòâ\nThank you to all the students, TAs and volunteers It has been a true \u0026quot;Ode to Joy\u0026quot; 1/2 https://t.co/SEMGRuSj9o\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) July 23, 2021  ","date":1628553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628553600,"objectID":"7508c3b09a02a94967995e22c60a616f","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/neuromatchplaylist/","publishdate":"2021-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/neuromatchplaylist/","section":"talk","summary":"Neuromatch Playlist.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"The Music of Neuromatch","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"In 2021 I helped organise a very enjoyable Pint of Science event.\nLooking forward to three excellent @pintofscienceIE talks on Health from DNA to Microbes to Health Informatics Wednesday at 18:30 @WeAreTUDublin Get your tickets here:https://t.co/yxq2PXRZJr pic.twitter.com/myeNq0F4tV\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) May 18, 2021 ","date":1621296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621296000,"objectID":"59ec24ea1ece9215855522f34bd3c88b","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/pos2021/","publishdate":"2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pos2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Pint of Science 2021.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"Health Buzz","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Michael Moore","James Loughman","John S Butler","Arne Ohlendorf","Siegfried Wahl","Daniel I Flitcroft"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619308800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619308800,"objectID":"ff206c775067ff6b7e1034625101e313","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2021_moorebigdata/","publishdate":"2021-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_moorebigdata/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose:\nTo examine whether data sourced from electronic medical records (EMR) and a large industrial spectacle lens manufacturing database can estimate refractive error distribution within large populations as an alternative to typical population surveys of refractive error.\nSubjects:\nA total of 555,528 patient visits from 28 Irish primary care optometry practices between the years 1980 and 2019 and 141,547,436 spectacle lens sales records from an international European lens manufacturer between the years 1998 and 2016.\nMethods:\nAnonymized EMR data included demographic, refractive and visual acuity values. Anonymized spectacle lens data included refractive data. Spectacle lens data was separated into lenses containing an addition (ADD) and those without an addition (SV). The proportions of refractive errors from the EMR data and ADD lenses were compared to published results from the European Eye Epidemiology (E3) Consortium and the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS).\nResults:\nAge and gender matched proportions of refractive error were comparable in the E3 data and the EMR data, with no significant difference in the overall refractive error distribution (œá2 = 527, p = 0.29, DoF = 510). EMR data provided a closer match to the E3 refractive error distribution by age than the ADD lens data. The ADD lens data, however, provided a closer approximation to the E3 data for total myopia prevalence than the GHS data, up to age 64.\nConclusions:\nThe prevalence of refractive error within a population can be estimated using EMR data in the absence of population surveys. Industry derived sales data can also provide insights on the epidemiology of refractive errors in a population over certain age ranges. EMR and industrial data may therefore provide a fast and cost-effective surrogate measure of refractive error distribution that can be used for future health service planning purposes.","tags":["Optometry"],"title":"Application of big-data for epidemiological studies of refractive error","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saoirse McCrann","James Loughman","John S Butler","Ian Flitcroft"],"categories":null,"content":"New @FrontYoungMinds paper for kids by @Saoirse_mcC @jamesloughman me and @IanFlitcroft about the possible relationship between smartphones and shortsightedness. @ceri https://t.co/PikBb8j8Bu\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) April 7, 2021 ","date":1617926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617926400,"objectID":"43e87779ab5c117300c733432473da0b","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/frontiersforyoungmindsopto/","publishdate":"2021-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/frontiersforyoungmindsopto/","section":"talk","summary":"Frontiers for Young Minds.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"Do smartphones hurt our eyes by causing shortsightedness?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ekaterina Loskutova","John S Butler","Gabriela Hernandez Martinez","Ian Flitcroft","James Loughman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"1b3477b683cbdb8ff9358dffb1eee44f","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2020_loskutova/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_loskutova/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose of the study: Macular pigment (MP), comprising the dietary carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin, is believed to benefit eye health and vision. Numerous clinical and research devices and techniques are currently available to facilitate MP optical density (MPOD) measurement. One of those techniques, dual-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (AF) is being increasingly used for measurement of MP in the eye. There is substantial methodological variation across the published studies that have employed this technique, including in relation to the use of mydriasis, the possible influence of which does not appear to have been addressed in the literature. This prospective cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the effect of mydriasis on MP measurement quality and MPOD values obtained with dual-wavelength AF using the Heidelberg Spectralis HRA+OCT device. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one healthy participants were recruited to the study. The mean age of participants was 44.8 years (¬± 14.63). Pupil size and MPOD were measured in one eye for each participant, initially under natural pupil conditions and subsequently 30 minutes following instillation of one drop of 0.5% tropicamide.

We have recently shown that electrophysiological markers of motor preparation, rather than decision-making, differentiate PwP with freezing of gait (FOG +) and without (FOG -) while sitting. To examine the effect of locomotion on these results, we measured behavioural and electrophysiological responses in PwP with and without FOG during a target response time task while sitting (single-task) and stepping-in-place (dual-task). Behavioural and electroencephalographic data were acquired from 18 PwP (eight FOG +) and seven young controls performing the task while sitting and stepping-in-place. FOG + had slower response times while stepping compared with sitting. However, response times were significantly faster while stepping compared with sitting for controls. Electrophysiological responses showed no difference in decision-making potentials (centroparietal positivity) between groups or conditions but there were differences in neurophysiological markers of response inhibition (N2) and motor preparation (lateralized readiness potential, LRP) in FOG + while performing a dual-task. This suggests that the addition of a second complex motor task (stepping-in-place) impacts automatic allocation of resources in FOG +, resulting in delayed response times. The impact of locomotion on the generation of the N2 and LRP potentials, particularly in freezers, indirectly implies that these functions compete with locomotion for resources. In the setting of multiple complex tasks or cognitive impairment, severe motor dysfunction may result, leading to freezing of gait.","tags":["Visual","EEG","P3","Parkinson's Disease","Freezing of Gait"],"title":"Neurophysiological correlates of dual tasking in people with Parkinson's disease and freezing of gait.","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Introducing...

Macular pigment optical density was measured using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. Clinical (blood pressure), plasma (lipoproteins, inflammatory markers), and anthropometric (waist, hip, height, weight) biomarkers were measured for each participant.\nRESULTS Mean (standard deviation) MPOD for the study group was 0.223 (0.161), with a range of 0 to 1.08. One-way ANOVA revealed that MPOD was significantly lower among participants with low plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL; P = .04), raised plasma triglyceride-to-HDL ratio (P = .003), and raised total cholesterol‚Äìto‚ÄìHDL ratio (P = .03). Subjects with an elevated waist circumference (WC) had a significantly lower MPOD (mean, 0.216 [0.159]) compared with those with an ideal WC (mean, 0.229 [0.162]; P = .03). Significant correlates of MPOD on mixed linear model analysis included education, smoking status, and WC.\nCONCLUSIONS Higher abdominal fat is associated with lower MPOD in this representative sample of older Irish adults. Although altered lipoprotein profiles (low HDL, raised triglyceride-to-HDL ratio, raised total cholesterol‚Äìto‚ÄìHDL ratio) may affect the transport, uptake, and stabilization of carotenoids in the retina, these plasma biomarkers were not predictive of low MPOD after adjustment for abdominal circumference. Although WC emerged as a viable anthropometric predictor of lower MPOD, its effect size seems to be small.","tags":["Optometry","Macular Pigment","Diabetes"],"title":"Investigation of Surrogate Biomarkers Associated with Macular Pigment Status in a Group of Older Irish Adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My first editorial assignment:\nI had the pleasure of editing this @FrontYoungMinds paper by @masonporter and colleagues titled: \u0026quot;Disease Detectives: Using Mathematics to Forecast the Spread of Infectious Diseases\u0026quot; It has an intutive explanation of why we care about the R0 value 1/2https://t.co/KnouIjf00I\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) February 9, 2021 ","date":1600732800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600732800,"objectID":"89d1c4219761770ce14712decbfbef6c","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/frontiersforyoungmindseditor/","publishdate":"2020-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/frontiersforyoungmindseditor/","section":"talk","summary":"Frontiers for Young Minds.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"Frontiers for Young Minds (Associate Editor)","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"For those interested in viewing our Undergraduate Talk competition tomorrow at 12pm, please DM us for an invitation link! pic.twitter.com/28r0iBtLZn\n\u0026mdash; SIAM-IMA Dublin Area Student Chapter (@SIAM_IMA_Dublin) August 12, 2020 ","date":1597881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597881600,"objectID":"9910e1f89bfc138a7ad6a9b10421e47f","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/siam_judge/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/siam_judge/","section":"talk","summary":"I had the pleasure of being a judge for the SIAM Dublin Undergraduate Competition","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"SIAM Undergraduate Talk Competition","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"In 2020 I helped at the Pint of Science on Space.\nAbsolutely brilliant astro talks in this session of @pintofscienceIE Really impressive and inspiring research being done by @petertgallagher @jaregan and @ciara_a_maguire https://t.co/lnxgehaFAB\n\u0026mdash; John Butler (@jslbutler) May 26, 2020 ","date":1590624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590624000,"objectID":"77e3c350c8a2da94e40211f79847a15e","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/pos2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pos2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Pint of Science 2020.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"Health Buzz","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laura Williams","John S Butler","Martin Thirkettle","Tom Stafford","Brendan Quinlivan","Eavan McGovern","Sean O'Riordan","Peter Redgrave","Richard Reilly","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"eb8016fd77803ebfa3c616e475b1628f","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2020_williams/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_williams/","section":"publication","summary":"Background\nAbnormal temporal discrimination in cervical dystonia is hypothesized to be attributable to disrupted processing in the superior colliculus. The fast, luminance-based, retinotectal pathway, projects to the superior colliculus; chromatic stimuli responses, by the retino-geniculo-calcarine pathway, are up to 30 ms longer.\nObjectives\nWe sought to interrogate visual processing and reaction times in patients with cervical dystonia compared with healthy controls. We hypothesized that cervical dystonia patients would have impaired reaction times to luminance based stimuli accessing the retino-tectal pathway in comparison to healthy control participants.\nMethods\nIn 20 cervical dystonia and 20 age-matched control participants, we compared reaction times to two flashing visual stimuli: (1) a chromatic annulus and (2) a luminant, noncolored annulus. Participants pressed a joystick control when they perceived the annulus flashing.\nResults\nReaction times in control participants were 20 ms significantly faster in the luminant condition than the chromatic (P = 0.017). Patients with cervical dystonia had no reaction time advantage in response to the luminant stimulus.\nConclusion\nCervical dystonia patients (compared to control participants) demonstrated no reduction in their reaction time to luminant stimuli, processed through the retinotectal pathway. This finding is consistent with superior colliculus dysfunction in cervical dystonia.","tags":["Dystonia"],"title":"Slowed luminance reaction times in cervical dystonia: disordered superior colliculus processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"We are now SOLD OUT for tonight.

It uses what you see, what you hear, and how your head and body move to help you judge your own movements. As you move, your brain must ensure that the world does not look blurry and that you can judge how fast you are moving, how far you are moving, and the direction you are heading. And of course, falling and collisions should be avoided! Self-motion is the term we use for movements we make with our bodies, such as walking, running, jumping, or even sitting still. This article explains how our brains achieve the amazing task of perceiving our own movements and how we use this information to stay balanced and navigate our world. It also describes what happens when errors in self-motion occur (due to illness/injury) and how the science of self-motion perception can enhance video games and virtual reality.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory"],"title":"FEELING OURSELVES MOVE: A TEAM EFFORT BY OUR SENSES","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574208000,"objectID":"e68940475c4ab745d9f3d4ea03eb1ef3","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/imascientist2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/imascientist2019/","section":"talk","summary":"I'm a Scientist get me out of here","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"I'm a Scientist get me out of here","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Modelling the Re-introduction of Wolves John S Butler\nSchool of Mathematical Sciences\nTU Dublin\nIntroduction This webpage will describe a mathematical model that simulates impact of the introduction of wolves on deer and plants population using Python.\nimport numpy as np import math %matplotlib inline import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # side-stepping mpl backend import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec # subplots import warnings font = {\u0026#39;family\u0026#39; : \u0026#39;normal\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;weight\u0026#39; : \u0026#39;bold\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;size\u0026#39; : 14} plt.rc(\u0026#39;font\u0026#39;, **font) from IPython.display import HTML HTML(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; code_show=true; function code_toggle() { if (code_show){ $(\u0026#39;div.input\u0026#39;).hide(); } else { $(\u0026#39;div.input\u0026#39;).show(); } code_show = !code_show } $( document ).ready(code_toggle); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;javascript:code_toggle()\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;Click here to toggle on/off the raw code.\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/form\u0026gt;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;)  code_show=true; function code_toggle() { if (code_show){ $('div.input').hide(); } else { $('div.input').show(); } code_show = !code_show } $( document ).ready(code_toggle);   What is mathematics used for?

It has been suggested in previous studies that lower zinc status is associated with myopia; however, this article shows no relationship between dietary zinc intake and myopia in U.S. adolescents.\nPURPOSE: It has been suggested that low zinc levels may contribute to the development of myopia. The aim of the present study is to examine, for the first time in a Western population, the association of total dietary and supplement zinc intake with myopia.\nMETHODS: A total of 1095 children/adolescents aged 12 to 19 years who participated in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2008 were enrolled in this study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between total zinc intake and myopia after adjustment for potential confounders. In addition, the association between total zinc intake and spherical equivalent refractive error was examined in the myopia group through multiple linear regression.\nRESULTS: Among study participants, 30% were found to be myopic (‚â§‚àí1.00 D). Although median total daily zinc intake was lower among myopes (10.8 [10.2] mg/d) than among nonmyopes (11.1 [10.8] mg/d), the difference was not statistically significant (P = .11). In multiple logistic regression analyses, zinc and copper intakes were not significantly associated with myopia after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, family income, recreational activity, copper intake, and daily energy intake (in kilocalories per day). In multiple linear regression, spherical equivalent refractive error was not associated with total zinc intake in the myopic group after adjustment for confounding factors (P = .13).\nCONCLUSIONS : In contrast to previous Asian studies, total zinc intake is not associated with the presence of myopia in U.S. adolescents/children.","tags":["Optometry"],"title":"Association of total zinc intake with myopia in US children and adolescents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Conor Fearon","John S Butler","Isabelle Killane","Saskia M.

The purpose of this evidence synthesis was to analyse the available data regarding the role of lutein and zeaxanthin for cognition in children and propose a theoretical basis for future studies. Methods: The PubMed, Scopus, the ISRCTN registry and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies that evaluated the relationship between lutein and zeaxanthin and cognitive function in children. Reference list and ancestry searches were performed on relevant articles. A total of 543 articles were identified, of which six cross-sectional studies were included. Results: The literature search revealed that the evidence concerning the effect of lutein and zeaxanthin on cognition in children is sparse. However, there is some preliminary evidence indicating a positive association between lutein and zeaxanthin and cognition in childhood. Conclusions: The cross-sectional nature of the few studies available and the lack of RCT data indicates a need for further investigation before any firm conclusions can be drawn.","tags":["Optometry","Macular Pigment","Myopia"],"title":"Lutein and zeaxanthin: The possible contribution, mechanisms of action and implications of modern dietary intake for cognitive development in children.","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559088000,"objectID":"9eb62df3bd5d3a625a72a40f8f5ec0ff","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/outreach/brightclub2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreach/brightclub2019/","section":"outreach","summary":"Birght Club.","tags":null,"title":"A mathematicians adventure in Neuroscience","type":"outreach"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1559088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559088000,"objectID":"53eb658f2136c728ceaa0720971b793b","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/brightclub/","publishdate":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/brightclub/","section":"talk","summary":"Bright Club Dublin.","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"A Mathematicians Adventures in Neuroscience (Part 1)","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558483200,"objectID":"f623d9f708945ee6024d786ee89dc351","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/outreach/pos2018/","publishdate":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreach/pos2018/","section":"outreach","summary":"Pint of Science 2018.","tags":null,"title":"An intrduction to Visual Vestibular Integration for self-motion.","type":"outreach"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Methods: MOSAIC is an investigator-led, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of 0.01% atropine for managing progression of myopia. During Phase 1 of the trial, 250 children aged 6-16 years with progressive myopia instil eye drops once nightly in both eyes from randomisation to month 24. No treatment is given during Phase 2 from month 24 to 36 (washout period) for those participants initially randomised to the intervention arm (n=167), during which any potential rebound effects on cessation of treatment will be monitored. All participants initially assigned to the placebo (n=83) crossover to the intervention arm of the study for Phase 2, and from month 24 to 36, instil 0.01% atropine eye drops in both eyes once nightly. Further treatment and monitoring beyond 36 months is planned (Phase 3) and will be designed dependent on the outcomes of Phase 1. Results: The primary outcome measure is cycloplegic spherical equivalent refractive error progression at 24 months. Secondary outcome measures include axial length change as well as the rebound, safety and acceptability profile of 0.01% atropine. Additional analyses will include the mechanisms of action of 0.01% atropine for myopia control. Conclusions: The generalisability of results from previous clinical trials investigating atropine for myopia control is limited by the predominantly Asian ethnicity of previous study populations. MOSAIC is the first RCT to explore the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of unpreserved 0.01% atropine in a predominantly White population.","tags":["Optometry","Macular Pigment","Myopia"],"title":"Myopia Outcome Study of Atropine in Children (MOSAIC): an investigator-led, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial protocol","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S Butler"],"categories":[],"content":"Probabilistic Decision Making by Slow Reverberation in Cortical Circuits Wang Neuron, December 5, 2002, 36:955-968\nIntroduction This notebook will work through the seminal paper by Wang (2002) to simulate synaptic decision making. The note book will follow the flow of the original paper and reproduce each figure.\nMaterial and Methods The two-variable network model  Figure 1: Model Architecture and Coherence-Dependent Stochastic inputs. (A) Schematic depiction of the model. There are two pyramidal cell groups (A and B), each of which is selective to one of the two stimuli (mimicking motion to the right or left). Within each pyramidal neural group there is strong recurrrent excitatory connections that can sustain persistent activity triggered by a transient preferred stimulus. The two neural groups compete through feedback inhibition from interneurons.\n(B) Top: the inputs are Poisson rates that vary in time and obey Gaussian distributions, with means ŒºA and ŒºB and with standard deviation œÉ. The means $Œº_A$ and $Œº_B$ depend on the coherence level linearly (insert). Bottom: an example of stochastic inputs to neural groups A and B with $Œº_0$ = 40 and $œÉ$ = 10 in Hz, c‚Ä≤ = 6.4%. At every 50 ms, the two stimuli are independently resampled using their Gaussian distributions, so that the inputs vary stochastically in time. If $œÉ$ = 0, the two inputs would be constant in time.\nThe Cortical Network Model The corical network consists of N=2000 neurons with excitaroty pyramidal cells ($N_E$=1600) and inhibitory $N_I$ interneurons ($N_I$=400).\nNeurons The Integrate and Fire Model The nuerons are simulated unsing the integrate and fire model: \\begin{equation} C_m\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} =-g_L(V(t)-V_L)-I_{syn}(t), \\end{equation} where $V(t)$ is the membrane potential, $C_m$ is the membrane capacity, $g_L$ is the membrane leak conductance, $V_L$ is the resting potential and $I_{syn}$ represents the total synaptic current flow.

Reaction Time Simulations Same parameters as in Figure 4.\n(A) During a 2 s stimulation, at the moment when one of the two neural groups reaches a fixed threshold (15 Hz) of population firing activity, the decision is made and the deliberation or decision time is read out. The decision time is longer and more variable at low coherence (left) than at high coherence (right). This is further quantified by the decision time histogram (bottom), which has a larger mean and is broader at low coherence (left) than at high coherence (right).\n(B) Left: Neurometric functions for the reaction time stimulation (circle) and with fixed stimulus duration of 1 s (square). The coherence threshold (defined by 82% correct) is Œ±RT = 8.4% and Œ±FD = 10.4%. Right: Average decision time is linear in the logarithm of the coherence level, ranging from 200 ms at high c‚Ä≤ to 800 ms at low c‚Ä≤. At very low coherence there is a saturation. Note the large standard deviation of decision time, especially at low coherence.\nFigure 6. Dependence of the Decision Performance on the Duration of Stimulus Presentation The stimulus offset is followed by a fixed delay of 2 s, and the decision choice is based on which of the two attractors wins the competition.\n(A) Neurometric function is shifted to the left with longer stimuli.\n(B) Coherence threshold (Œ± defined by 82% correct choices) decreases with the stimulus duration and plateaus for stimulus presentation longer than 1.5 s.\n Figure 7. Optimal Decision-Making Performance Requires Sufficiently Strong and Slow Synaptic Reverberations (A) When the strength of recurrent connections is weaker (w+ = 1.4 instead of w+ = 1.7), attractor dynamics can no longer be sustained by intrinsic network excitation. Neural activities of subpopulation A (left) and B (right) are shown at two coherence levels (1.6% and 51.2%). Same conventions as in Figure 2. In this case, there is a reduced time integration (ramping activity), categorical choice at low coherence is lost, and mnemonic persistent activity is absent during the delay period.\n(B) Network behavior with an increased strength of recurrent connections (w+ = 1.8). Left: population activities in ten individual trials for the control (red, neural group A; blue, neural group B) and for enhanced recurrency (purple, neural group A; green, neural group B). With stronger excitatory reverberations, persistent activity level is doubled (from 20 Hz in control to 40 Hz), and the integration time of stimulus is shortened by a half. The performance is reduced from 72% to 60% correct at c‚Ä≤ = 6.4%. Right: the network\u0026rsquo;s performance is worse, with the neurometric function\u0026rsquo;s threshold increased from 8.4% (red) to 15.6% (purple).  (A) The input signal is reversed during stimulation, where the signal strength is weak (6.4%) and the same before and after the reversal. Percentage choices for A and B as function of the onset time of reversal. The dependence is initially linear as a function of the time of reversal, consistent with an integration of the first and second inputs of the opposite signs. However, the behavioral performance is no longer affected if signal reversal occurs too late (e.g., the reversal time is larger than 700 ms after the stimulus onset), when the network becomes dominated by the intrinsic attractor dynamics.\n(B) Even when the signal is reversed 1 s after the stimulus onset, the decision is still reversable by a more powerful input. Percentage choices for A and B as function of the coherence level of the reversed signal. When the new input is sufficiently large (coherence above 70%‚Äì80%), the decision is always reversed in favor of the ‚Äúnew evidence.‚Äù\n(C) Examples for control (top) and signal reversal from c‚Ä≤ = 6.4% to ‚àí80% at 1 s after the stimulus onset (bottom). Note the slow ramp-down of population activity in group A (red), and ramp-up of population activity in group B (blue) during the second half of the stimulation when the decision is reversed.\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549324800,"objectID":"a864892797ddf91a926de19be38e77cf","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/decision/wang2002/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/decision/wang2002/","section":"Decision","summary":"Jupyter Notebook of the Neuron paper by Wang (2002) titled Probabilistic Decision Making by Slow Reverberation in Cortical Circuits","tags":[],"title":"Probabilistic Decision Making by Slow Reverberation in Cortical Circuits","type":"Decision"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

On the other hand, if there is a shortage in the number of prey, the number of predators will decrease due to the scaricty of food source [1].\nFish and Salmon In a balanced eco system the relationship between small fish (prey) and salmon (predator) can be described mathematically using a Loketta-Volterra model [2-4] \\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{d F}{dt}=F-0.02SF,\\\n\\frac{d S}{dt}=-0.05S+0.001 F S,\\\n\\end{array} \\end{equation} this set of equations models the interaction between small fish (F) and salmon (S).\nThe equations can be written in words as:\n   The rate of change of population is equal to the current population with a control factor     The increase in fish population $\\frac{d F}{dt}$ is equal to the current fish population $F$ minus the amount of fish salmon eat $-0.02FS$   The increase in salmon population $\\frac{d S}{dt}$ is equal to the current salmon population $-0.05S$ plus the amount of fish salmon eat $+0.001FS$    Or they can be summed up as the salmon are the predators who eat the small fish to survive.\nFigure 2 shows a simulation of the populations of salmon and small fish from 2000 to 2100, assuming that nothing is added to enviroment. The salmon population fluxuates between 45 and 55 billion while the small fish population fluctuates from 25 to 85 billion. The equation illustates a relative equilibrium between the two populations ensuring neither population gets too big or too small.\n# INITIAL CONDITIONS N=10000 time = np.linspace(2000, 2100, N ) # time h=100/N fish=50*np.ones(N) # 60 billions small fish salmon=45*np.ones(N) # 30 billion salmon SMALLFISH = np.array( [1,-0.02]) SALMON= np.array([-0.05,0.001]) for i in range (1,N): fish[i]=fish[i-1]+h*fish[i-1]*(SMALLFISH[0]+SMALLFISH[1]*salmon[i-1]) salmon[i]=salmon[i-1]+h*salmon[i-1]*(SALMON[0]+SALMON[1]*fish[i-1]) ## PLOTTING fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,4)) plt.plot(time, fish, \u0026#39;r-\u0026#39;, label=\u0026#39;small fish\u0026#39;) plt.plot(time, salmon, \u0026#39;b-\u0026#39;, label=\u0026#39;salmon\u0026#39;) plt.grid() plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;time (years)\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Population (billions)\u0026#39;) plt.title(\u0026#39;Figure 2: Predator Predy relationship of Salmon and small fish\u0026#39;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026#39;best\u0026#39;) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() Humans Human population growth Humans are adaptable omnivores who have fire and tools so we are able to eat most animals and plants [5]. This means humans violate this the cyclical relationship. When humans have eaten all of one prey, such as the dodo, we just move on to another prey with seemingly little impact on human population growth. From 1800 to 1900 the human population increased by 60% from 1 billion to 1.6 billion. From 1900 to 2000 the human population has increased by almost 400% from 1.6 to 6 billion. Figure 3 shows the predicted increase in human population (yellow) in billions from 6 billion in 2000 to around 16 billion in 2100. The population should level off as number of foods sources can only sustain so many huamns. This growth can be descibed as a the equation: \\begin{equation} \\frac{d H}{dt}=0.05H-0.003H^2, \\end{equation} where $H$ is human population. The equations can be written in words as:\n   Rate of change of Population is equal to the current population and a control factor     The increase in human population $\\frac{d H}{dt}$ is equal to the current human population $0.05H$ minus a factor to control for over population $-0.003H^2$   It can be summed up as the human population keeps increasing until there is nothing left to eat.      humans=6*np.ones(N) # 6 billion humans for i in range (1,N): humans[i]=humans[i-1]+h*humans[i-1]*(0.05-0.003*humans[i-1]) fig= plt.figure(figsize=(8,4)) plt.plot(time, humans, \u0026#39;y-\u0026#39;, label = \u0026#39;Humans\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;time (yrs)\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Population (billions)\u0026#39;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026#39;best\u0026#39;) plt.tight_layout() plt.ylim(0,20) plt.title(\u0026#39;Figure 3: Human Population\u0026#39;) plt.show() Impact of Humans Due to the increasing human population the demand on food sources is getting highter and higher. This demand could put popular food sources at risk of being eaten into extinction. In the recent decades, governments have tried to address this by introduction quotas and identifying at risk animals. While this can address the direct impact of humans on the ecosystem it does not address the indirect by products of modern life such as microplastics.\nMicroPlastics and Humans Microplastics is any plastic entity which is approximately less than 5mm in size [6] (http://www.dit.ie/physics/research/microplastics/). The increase in microplastics can be modelled as a relationship with the human population. This can be descrived by the equation:\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{d P}{dt}=plastic_{rate}H. \\end{array} \\end{equation}\nThe parameter $plastic_{rate}$ is used the describe the relationship between the human population (H) and the rate of increase in microplastics (P) production.\n   The rate of change of population is equal to $=$ the current population with a control factor     The increase in microplastics $\\frac{d P}{dt}$ is equal to $=$ the current human population $H$ times the plastic production rate $plastic_{rate}$    Positive values of production rate mean the more humans, the more microplastics. Even if the production of micropalstics is stopped, the amount of microplastics will remain the same. So even after humans are gone, our plastic foot print will remain.\ndef plastic_model(plastic_rate): humans=6*np.ones(N) # 30 billion salmon plastics=1*np.ones(N) # 1 billion microplastics for i in range (1,N): plastics[i]=plastics[i-1]+h*humans[i-1]*(plastic_rate) humans[i]=humans[i-1]+h*humans[i-1]*(0.05-0.003*humans[i-1]) fig= plt.figure(figsize=(8,3)) plt.plot(time, plastics, \u0026#39;g\u0026#39;, label = \u0026#39;Microplastics\u0026#39;) plt.plot(time, humans, \u0026#39;y-\u0026#39;, label = \u0026#39;Humans\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;time (yrs)\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Population\u0026#39;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026#39;best\u0026#39;) plt.tight_layout() plt.title(\u0026#39;Figure 4: Relationship of Human Population and Microplastics with a plastic rate = %s\u0026#39;%(plastic_rate)) plt.show() In Figure 4 the rate of microplastic production can be manipulated to illustrate the result of a change in amount of microplastics. The figure plots modelled microplastics (green) and human population as a function of time from 2000 to 2100.\nplastic_model(0.01); Microplastics and Fish While fishing quotas account for the direct impact of man on fish it does not account for by-products of modern life like mircroplastics to the ecosystem. It has been documented that fish are now consuming microplastics which can impact the population of fish.\nFor these reasons we consider microplastics as a predator of small fish. To model the impact of microplastics on small fish (prey) and the knock on effect it has on salmon (prey).\nTo model the negative impact of microplastics on the small fish population an extra term is added to the small fish equation: \\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cl} \\frac{d F}{dt}=F-0.02SF-0.01FP.\\\n\\end{array} \\end{equation}\n   The rate of change of population is equal to $=$ the current population with a control factor     The change in small fish $\\frac{d F}{dt}$ is equal to $=$ the current fish population $F$ minus the amount salmon eat $-0.02SF$ minus the amount that die due to microplastics $-0.01FP$    The ecosystem model Bringing all these equations together results in a system of four first order differential equations which describe a simple ecosystem of,\nthe population of Small Fish (F), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d F}{dt}=F-0.02SF-0.01FP; \\end{equation} the population of salmon (S), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d S}{dt}=-0.05S+0.001 F S; \\end{equation} plastic production (P), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d P}{dt}=plastic_{rate}H; \\end{equation} and human population (H), \\begin{equation} \\frac{d H}{dt}=0.0001H-0.002H^2+0.0006SH+0.001HF. \\end{equation} The system was modeled from 2000 to the year 2100 are shown in the Figures bellow for different plastic rates.

The introduction of microplastics in to the ecosystem will lead to the extinction of small fish (red) by 2080 and salmon (blue) will be more or less extinct by 2100.\nplastic_fish_model(0.1) Open Questions The model shows the destructive impact of microplastics on a simple ecosystem model of small fish, salmon, microplastics and humans. Mathematical models of this type can be used to discuss\nThe immediate questions that arise from this simulation are:\n What is our current rate of plastic production? How will the extinction of small fish impact the human population? How can we do to prevent this from happening?

Previous studies have demonstrated changes in behavior and gait with increased sensory and cognitive load, but the underlying cortical mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present study, in a mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approach, 16 young adults walked on a treadmill with high-density EEG while 3-dimensional (3D) motion capture tracked kinematics of the head and feet. Visual load was manipulated with the presentation of optic flow with and without continuous mediolateral perturbations. The effects of cognitive load were assessed by the performance of a go/no-go task on half of the blocks. During increased sensory load, participants walked with shorter and wider strides, which may indicate a more restrained pattern of gait. Interestingly, cognitive task engagement attenuated these effects of sensory load on gait. Using an independent component analysis and dipole-fitting approach, we found that cautious gait was accompanied by neuro-oscillatory modulations localized to frontal (supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex) and parietal (inferior parietal lobule, precuneus) areas. Our results show suppression in alpha/mu (8‚Äì12 Hz) and beta (13‚Äì30 Hz) rhythms, suggesting enhanced activation of these regions with unreliable sensory inputs. These findings provide insight into the neural correlates of gait adaptation and may be particularly relevant to older adults who are less able to adjust to ongoing cognitive and sensory demands while walking.","tags":["Visual","Power Spectral Density","Walking","MoBI","EEG"],"title":"Cognitive load reduces the effects of optic flow on gait and electrocortical dynamics during treadmill walking","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"8017a22c147abec6323dd2003b0fa52e","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/talk/scienceweek2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/scienceweek2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Science Week 2018.","tags":null,"title":"Mathematics and the Brain","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Robert Ramkhalawansingh","John S Butler","Jennifer L Campos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"4edb147ebddc8bfd0d1c48d9dfafa864","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2017_aging_heading/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_aging_heading/","section":"publication","summary":"Younger adults integrate visual and vestibular cues to self-motion in a manner consistent with optimal integration; however, little is currently known about whether this process changes with older age. Our objective was to determine whether older adults, like younger adults, display evidence of optimal visual‚Äìvestibular integration, including reductions in bimodal variance (Visual-Vestibular) compared with unimodal variance (visual or vestibular alone), and reliability-based cue weighting. We used a motion simulator and a head-mounted display to introduce a 2-interval forced-choice heading estimation task.

Movements consisted of vestibular cues (passive movement in darkness), visual cues (optic flow), or both cues combined. The combined condition contained either congruent cues or incongruent cues (either a subtle 5¬∞ or larger 20¬∞ conflict). Results demonstrated that older adults had less reliable visual heading estimates than younger adults but comparable vestibular heading estimates. During combined, congruent conditions, both age groups exhibited reductions in combined variance, consistent with predicted optimal integration. During subtle cue conflicts, only younger adults exhibited combined variance consistent with predicted optimal integration, but both age groups displayed reliability-based cue weighting. During larger spatial conflicts, neither group demonstrated optimal reductions in variance. Younger adults displayed reliability-based cue weighting but older adults‚Äô heading estimates were biased toward the less reliable visual estimate. Older adults‚Äô tendency to incorporate spatially conflicting and unreliable visual cues into their self-motion percept may affect their performance on mobility-related tasks like walking and driving.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory","Aging"],"title":"Visual‚ÄìVestibular Integration During Self-Motion Perception in Younger and Older Adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526947200,"objectID":"132c64dd619126a12f9e862a29aaccf1","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/outreach/scienceweek2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreach/scienceweek2018/","section":"outreach","summary":"Scienece Week 2018.","tags":null,"title":"Science Week 2018","type":"outreach"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"In 2018 I gave my firat Pint of Science talk on my work on Visual Vestibular Integration.

This study aims to increase our understanding of parental attitudes to myopia development and control, as a means to inform future health planning and policy. It evaluates, for the first time, the attitude of parents to myopia and its associated risks, as well as assessing the exposure of Irish children to environmental factors that may influence their risk profile for myopia development. METHODS: Parents of 8-13 year old children in eight participating schools completed a questionnaire designed to assess their knowledge of and attitudes towards myopia and its risk factors. A structured diary was also used to capture daily activities of children in relation to myopia risk factors. RESULTS: Of 329 parents, just 46% considered that myopia presented a health risk to their children, while an identical number (46%) regarded it as an optical inconvenience. Myopia was also, but less frequently, considered an expense (31% of parents), a cosmetic inconvenience (14% of parents) and, by some, as a sign of intelligence (4% of parents) 76% of parents recognised the potential of digital technology to impact the eye, particularly as a cause of eyestrain and need for spectacles. Only 14% of parents expressed concern should their child be diagnosed with myopia.

The present experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that disrupted superior collicular processing is evident in affected patients and in relatives harbouring a disease-specific endophenotype (abnormal temporal discrimination). The study participants were 16 cervical dystonia patients, 16 unaffected first-degree relatives with abnormal temporal discrimination, 16 unaffected first-degree relatives with normal temporal discrimination and 16 healthy controls. The response of participant‚Äôs superior colliculi to looming stimuli was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Cervical dystonia patients and relatives with abnormal temporal discrimination demonstrated (i) significantly reduced superior collicular activation for whole brain and region of interest analysis; (ii) a statistically significant negative correlation between temporal discrimination threshold and superior collicular peak values. Our results support the hypothesis that disrupted superior collicular processing is involved in the pathogenesis of cervical dystonia.

This approach, termed Mobile Brain/ Body Imaging (MoBI), has the potential to elucidate the neural correlates of perceptual and cognitive processes during real-life activities, such as locomotion. However, as of yet, no one has assessed the long-term stability of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded under these conditions. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of cognitive ERPs recorded while walking. High-density EEG was ac- quired from 12 young adults on two occasions, separated by an average of 2.3 years, as they performed a Go/ No-Go response inhibition paradigm. During each testing session, participants performed the task while walking on a treadmill and seated. Using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as a measure of agreement, we fo- cused on two well-established neurophysiological correlates of cognitive control, the N2 and P3 ERPs. Following ICA-based artifact rejection, the earlier N2 yielded good to excellent levels of reliability for both amplitude and latency, while measurements for the later P3 component were generally less robust but still indicative of ade- quate to good levels of stability. Interestingly, the N2 was more consistent between walking sessions, compared to sitting, for both hits and correct rejection trials. In contrast, the P3 waveform tended to have a higher degree of consistency during sitting conditions. Overall, these results suggest that the electro-cortical signals obtained during active walking are representative of stable indices of neurophysiological function.","tags":["Visual","MoBI","Walking","EEG"],"title":"Long-term test-retest reliability of event-related potential (ERP) recordings during treadmill walking using the mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rebecca B Beck","Eavan M McGovern","John S Butler","Dorina Birsanu","Brendan Quinlivan","Ines Beiser","Shruti Narasimham","Sean O'Riordan","Michael Hutchinson","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"a643c320c7275c2b9844aafb67cc5336","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2017_beck-jove/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_beck-jove/","section":"publication","summary":"The temporal discrimination threshold (TDT) is the shortest time interval at which an observer can discriminate two sequential stimuli as being asynchronous (typically 30-50 ms).

The pathophysiology of FOG remains poorly understood but is associated with deficits in cognitive function and motor preparation. Method: We studied 20 people with PD (10 with FOG, 10 without FOG) and performed a timed response target detection task while electroencephalographic data were acquired. We analysed the data to detect and examine cortical markers of cognitive decision making (P3b or centroparietal positivity, CPP) and motor readiness potential. We analysed current source density (CSD) to increase spatial resolution and allow identification of distinct signals. Results: There was no difference in the P3b/CPP response between people with PD with and without FOG, suggesting equivalent cognitive processing with respect to decision-making. However, the FOG group had significant difference with an earlier onset and larger amplitude of the lateralized readiness potential. Furthermore, the amplitude of the lateralised readiness potential correlated strongly with total Frontal Assessment Battery score. Conclusions: The difference in lateralized readiness potentials may reflect excessive recruitment of lateral premotor areas to compensate for dysfunction of the supplementary motor area and resultant loss of automatic motor control. This early, excessive recruitment of frontal networks occurs in spite of equivalent motor scores and reaction times between groups. Significance: The saturation of frontal processing mechanisms could help explain deficits in attentional set-shifting, dual-tasking and response inhibition which are frequently reported in FOG.","tags":["Visual","EEG","P3","Parkinson's Disease","Freezing of Gait"],"title":"Motor Preparation Rather Than Decision-Making Differentiates Parkinson's Disease Patients With And Without Freezing of Gait","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eavan M McGovern","John S Butler","Ines Beiser","Laura Williams","Brendan Quinlivan","Shruti Narasiham","Rebecca Beck","Sean O‚ÄôRiordan","Richard B Reilly","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"b4fabdf4a01a6f58ec00e93bf1fb05ad","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2016_mcgovern/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_mcgovern/","section":"publication","summary":"The temporal discrimination threshold (TDT) is the shortest time interval at which an individual detects two stimuli to be asynchronous (normal=30‚Äì50ms).

Up to 97% of patients have an abnormal TDT with age- and sex-related penetrance in unaffected relatives, demonstrating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. These findings support the use of the TDT as a pre-clinical biomarker for AOIFD. The usual stimulus presentation method involves the presentation of progressively asynchronous stimuli; when three sequential stimuli are reported asynchronous is taken as a participant's TDT. To investigate the robustness of the 'staircase' method of presentation, we introduced a method of randomised presentation order to explore any potential 'learning effect' that may be associated with this existing method. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in temporal discrimination using two methods of stimulus presentation. Thirty healthy volunteers were recruited to the study (mean age 33.73¬±3.4 years). Visual and tactile TDT testing using a staircase and randomised method of presentation order was carried out in a single session. There was a strong relationship between the staircase and random method for TDT values. This observed consistency between testing methods suggests that the existing experimental approach is a robust method of recording an individual's TDT. In addition, our newly devised randomised paradigm is a reproducible and more efficient method for data acquisition in the clinic setting. However, the two presentation methods yield different absolute TDT results and either of the two methods should be used uniformly in all participants in any one particular study.","tags":["Dystonia","Temporal Discrimination Threshold"],"title":"A comparison of stimulus presentation methods in temporal discrimination testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Williams","Eavan McGovern","Okka Kimmich","Anna Molloy","Ines Beiser","John S Butler","Fiona Molloy","Paul Lonogan","Daniel G Healy","Niall Byrne","Tim Lynch","Helena Moore","Mark J Edwards","Cathal Walsh","Sean O'Riordan","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"40886afaa3ca6a7b58bcb67ede066ff5","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2015_williams-epidemilogy/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_williams-epidemilogy/","section":"publication","summary":"Background Adult onset primary torsion dystonia (AOPTD) is a poorly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder; most gene carriers are non-manifesting despite having reached an adequate age for penetrance. It is hypothesised that genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors may exert protective or deleterious effects on penetrance of AOPTD. By examining environmental exposure history in cervical dystonia patients and their similarly aged unaffected siblings we aimed to determine the role of previous environmental exposures in relation to disease penetrance. Methods A case-control study of 67 patients with cervical dystonia and 67 of their age-matched unaffected siblings was performed. Past environmental exposures were assessed using a detailed 124-question standardised questionnaire. Results By univariate analysis, cervical dystonia patients, compared to their unaffected siblings, had an increased frequency of a history of car accidents with hospital attendance (OR 10.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 47.4, p=0.004) and surgical episodes (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.76 to 23.61, p=0.005). Following multivariate analysis, car accidents with hospital attendance (OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 37.6, p=0.017) and all surgical episodes (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.24 to 19.31, p=0.023) remained significantly associated with case status. Conclusions Cervical dystonia patients had a history, prior to symptom onset, of significantly more frequent episodes of surgery and of car accidents with hospital attendance than their age-matched unaffected siblings.

Age- and sex-related effects on temporal discrimination demonstrate that women, before the age of 40 years, have faster temporal discrimination than men but their TDTs worsen with age at almost three times the rate of men. Thus after 40 years the TDT in women is progressively worse than in men. AOIFD is an increasingly female-predominant disorder after the age of 40; it is not clear whether this age-related sexually-dimorphic difference observed for both the TDT and sex ratio at disease onset in AOIFD is a hormonal or chromosomal effect. The aim of this study was to examine temporal discrimination at weekly intervals during two consecutive menstrual cycles in 14 healthy female volunteers to determine whether physiological hormonal changes affected temporal discrimination. We observed no significant differences in weekly temporal discrimination threshold values during the menstrual cycles and no significant correlation with the menstrual cycle stage. This observed stability of temporal discrimination during cyclical hormonal change raises interesting questions concerning the age-related sexually-dimorphic decline observed in temporal discrimination.

We employed one such system (Oculus Rift DK2) in this study to present visual stimulus and acquire head-turn data from a cohort of 40 healthy adults. Participants were asked to complete head movements towards eccentrically located visual targets following valid and invalid cues. Such tasks are commonly employed for investigating the effects orientation of attention and are known as Posner cueing paradigms. Electrooculography was also recorded for a subset of 18 participants.

Here a visuospatial learning task requiring fine motor control is employed to investigate visuospatial learning in a group of typically developing adults. Electrophysiological and behavioural data is collected during a target location task under two experimental conditions, Target Learning and Target Cued. Movement times are employed as a behavioural metric of performance while dynamic P3b amplitudes and power in the alpha band (approximately 10 Hz) are explored as electrophysiological metrics during visuospatial learning. Results demonstrate that task performance, as measured by movement time, is highly correlated with P3b amplitude and alpha power at a consecutive trial level (trials 1 - 30). The current set of results, in conjunction with the existing literature, suggests that changes in P3b amplitude and alpha power could correspond to different aspects of the learning process. Here it is hypothesized that changes in P3b correspond to a diminishing inter-stimulus-interval and reduced stimulus relevance while the corresponding changes in alpha power represent an automation of response as habituation occurs in participants. The novel analysis presented in the current study demonstrates how gradual electrophysiological changes can be tracked during the visuospatial learning process under the current paradigm.","tags":["Visual","EEG","Visuospatial memory","P3","Alpha"],"title":"Exploring the unknown: electrophysiological and behavioural measures of visuospatial learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"66cf7301d4a88a1fedbaefa75a116297","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/project/ceri/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ceri/","section":"project","summary":"My optomentry research with Prof James Loughman is to investigate the causes, impacts and intervetions of glaucoma and myopia, for more detail go to the Centre for Eye Research Ireland (CERI).","tags":["ceri","Optometry","Glaucoma","Myopia"],"title":"Centre for Eye Research Ireland","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is an ongoing, possibly Sisyphus, project in which I am writing iPython notebooks of mathematical models in Neuroscience.

Importantly, comparable sensory deficits have also been established in healthy first-degree biological relatives of patients with schizophrenia and in first-episode drug-naive patients. The clear implication is that these measures are endophenotypic, related to the underlying genetic liability for schizophrenia. However, there is significant overlap between patient response distributions and those of healthy individuals without affected first-degree relatives. Here we sought to develop more sensitive measures of sensory dysfunction in this population, with an eye to establishing endophenotypic markers with better predictive capabilities. We used a sensory adaptation paradigm in which electrophysiological responses to basic visual and somatosensory stimuli presented at different rates (ranging from 250 to 2550 ms interstimulus intervals, in blocked presentations) were compared. Our main hypothesis was that adaptation would be substantially diminished in schizophrenia, and that this would be especially prevalent in the visual system. High-density event-related potential recordings showed amplitude reductions in sensory adaptation in patients with schizophrenia (N = 15 Experiment 1, N = 12 Experiment 2) compared with age-matched healthy controls (N=15 Experiment 1, N = 12 Experiment 2), and this was seen for both sensory modalities. At the individual participant level, reduced adaptation was more robust for visual compared with somatosensory stimulation. These results point to significant impairments in short-term sensory plasticity across sensory modalities in schizophrenia. These simple-to-execute measures may prove valuable as candidate endophenotypes and will bear follow-up in future work.","tags":["Visual","EEG","Schizophrenia","Adaptation","Aging"],"title":"Atypical visual and somatosensory adaptation in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Molloy","Laura Williams","Okka Kimmich","John S Butler","Eavan McGovern","Sean O'Riordan","Richard B Reilly","Cathal Walsh","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"9c233543a22e85bf9cfe3e95e3e51b1d","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2014_molloy-latitude/","publishdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_molloy-latitude/","section":"publication","summary":"Background Adult-onset isolated focal dystonia may present with various phenotypes including blepharospasm and cervical dystonia.

The neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying changes in sensory reactivity are not well understood. Based on the idea that neurodevelopmental changes in somatosensory processing and/or changes in sensory adaptation might underlie developmental differences in somatosensory reactivity, high-density electroencephalography was used to examine how the nervous system responds and adapts to repeated vibrotactile stimulation over childhood. Participants aged 6‚Äì18 yr old were presented with 50-ms vibrotactile stimuli to the right wrist over the median nerve at 5 blocked interstimulus intervals (ranging from ‚àº7 to ‚àº1 stimulus per second). Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) revealed three major phases of activation within the first 200 ms, with scalp topographies suggestive of neural generators in contralateral somatosensory cortex. Although overall SEPs were highly similar for younger, middle, and older age groups (6.1‚Äì9.8, 10.0‚Äì12.9, and 13.0‚Äì17.8 yr old), there were significant age-related amplitude differences in initial and later phases of the SEP. In contrast, robust adaptation effects for fast vs. slow presentation rates were observed that did not differ as a function of age. A greater amplitude response in the later portion of the SEP was observed for the youngest group and may be related to developmental changes in responsivity to somatosensory stimuli. These data suggest the protracted development of the somatosensory system over childhood, whereas adaptation, as assayed in this study, is largely in place by ‚àº7 yr of age.","tags":["Somatosensory","EEG","Adaptation","Development"],"title":"The neural dynamics of somatosensory processing and adaptation across childhood: a high-density electrical mapping study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S Butler","Ines M Beiser","Laura Williams","Eavan McGovern","Fiona Molloy","Tim Lynch","Dan G Healy","Helena Moore","Richard Walsh","Richard B Reilly","Sean O Riordan","Cathal Walsh","Michael Hutchinson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"3898bdfd2d9babf897c45e4590b43b37","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2015_hutchinson-sexual-dimorphism-and-gaba/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_hutchinson-sexual-dimorphism-and-gaba/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Adult-onset isolated focal dystonia (AOIFD) presenting in early adult life is more frequent in men, whereas in middle age it is female predominant.

This ‚Äòadaptation‚Äô is believed to represent mechanisms by which sensory systems reduce responsivity to consistent environmental inputs, freeing resources to respond to potentially more relevant inputs. While auditory adaptation functions have been relatively well characterized, considerably less is known about visual adaptation in humans. Here, high-density visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded while two paradigms were used to interrogate visual adaptation. The first presented stimulus pairs with varying ISIs, comparing VEP amplitude to the second stimulus with that of the first (paired-presentation). The second involved blocks of stimulation (N = 100) at various ISIs and comparison of VEP amplitude between blocks of differing ISIs (block-presentation). Robust VEP modulations were evident as a function of presentation rate in the block-paradigm, with strongest modulations in the 130‚Äì150 ms and 160‚Äì180 ms visual processing phases. In paired-presentations, with ISIs of just 200‚Äì300 ms, an enhancement of VEP was evident when comparing S2 with S1, with no significant effect of presentation rate. Importantly, in block-presentations, adaptation effects were statistically robust at the individual participant level. These data suggest that a more taxing block-presentation paradigm is better suited to engage visual adaptation mechanisms than a paired-presentation design. The increased sensitivity of the visual processing metric obtained in the block-paradigm has implications for the examination of visual processing deficits in clinical populations.","tags":["Visual","EEG","Adaptation"],"title":"Spatio-temporal dynamics of adaptation in the human visual system; a high-density electrical mapping study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Conor Fearon","John S Butler","Louis Newman","Timothy Lynch","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"c2b9341dc60aa47807f6506f71336e03","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2015_fearon_avsrt_pd/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_fearon_avsrt_pd/","section":"publication","summary":"Background; Sensory and perceptual disturbances are prominent in Parkinson‚Äôs PD and probably contribute to motor deficits such as bradykinesia and gait disturbances, including freezing of gait. Simple reaction time tests are a helpful way to explore sensory responses, as they require little cognitive processing. However, reaction times reflect both sensory and motor processing and thus relative differences between modalities should be examined to reflect true sensory processing taking motor delays into account. Multisensory integration is the ability of the brain to integrate sensory information from multiple modalities into a single coherent percept, which is crucial when interacting with our environment such as for complex motor output. Objectives; The goal of this study was to; 1. Assess differences in unisensory (auditory and visual) and multisensory processing speed in people with PD and age-matched healthy controls. 2. Compare relative differences in unisensory processing in people with PD with disease duration and freezing of gait status taking into account the motor delays, which are invariably present in PD. 3. Compare relative differences in multisensory (audiovisual) processing between the PD cohort and age-matched controls.Methods; 39 people with PD and 17 age-matched healthy controls performed a reaction time task in response to unisensory (auditory-alone, visual-alone) and multisensory (audiovisual) stimuli. Results; Relative unisensory differences occur in PD which are correlated with freezing of gait status and disease duration as well as multisensory processing differenes between people with PD and healthy controls.

The exact hierarchical level of multisensory convergence zones and the timing of their inputs are still under debate, although increasingly, evidence points to multisensory integration (MSI) at very early sensory processing levels. While MSI is said to be governed by stimulus properties including space, time, and magnitude, violations of these rules have been documented. The objective of the current study was to determine, both psychophysically and electrophysiologically, whether differential visual-somatosensory (VS) integration patterns exist for stimuli presented to the same versus opposite hemifields. Using high-density electrical mapping and complementary psychophysical data, we examined multisensory integrative processing for combinations of visual and somatosensory inputs presented to both left and right spatial locations. We assessed how early during sensory processing VS interactions were seen in the event-related potential and whether spatial alignment of the visual and somatosensory elements resulted in differential integration effects. Reaction times to all VS pairings were significantly faster than those to the unisensory conditions, regardless of spatial alignment, pointing to engagement of integrative multisensory processing in all conditions. In support, electrophysiological results revealed significant differences between multisensory simultaneous VS and summed V + S responses, regardless of the spatial alignment of the constituent inputs. Nonetheless, multisensory effects were earlier in the aligned conditions, and were found to be particularly robust in the case of right-sided inputs (beginning at just 55 ms). In contrast to previous work on audio-visual and audio-somatosensory inputs, the current work suggests a degree of spatial specificity to the earliest detectable multisensory integrative effects in response to VS pairings.","tags":["Visual","Somatosensory","EEG","Multisensory","Aging"],"title":"Keeping in touch with the visual system: spatial alignment and multisensory integration of visual-somatosensory inputs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brenda Malcolm","John J.

This may be particularly problematic during everyday multitasking situations when cognitively demanding tasks are performed while walking. Due to previous limitations in neuroimaging technology, much remains unknown about the cortical mechanisms underlying resource allocation during locomotion. Here, we utilized an EEG-based Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) technique that integrates high-density event-related potential (ERP) recordings with simultaneously acquired foot-force sensor data to monitor gait patterns and brain activity concurrently. To assess effects of motor load on cognition we evaluated young (N=17; mean age=27.2) and older adults (N=16; mean age=63.9) and compared behavioral and ERP measures associated with performing a Go/No-Go response inhibition task as participants sat stationary or walked on a treadmill. Stride time and variability were also measured during task performance and compared to stride parameters obtained without task performance, thereby assessing effects of cognitive load on gait. Results showed that older, but not young adults‚Äô accuracy dropped significantly when performing the inhibitory task while walking. Young adults revealed ERP modulations at relatively early (N2 amplitude reduction) and later (earlier P3 latency) stages within the processing stream as motor load increased while walking. In contrast, older adults‚Äô ERP modulations were limited to later processing stages (increased P3 amplitude) of the inhibitory network. The relative delay and attenuation of ERP modulations accompanied by behavioral costs in older participants might indicate an age-associated loss in flexible resource allocation across multiple tasks. Better understanding of the neural underpinnings of these age-related changes may lead to improved strategies to reduce fall risk and enhance mobility in aging.","tags":["Visual","EEG","MoBI","Aging","Walking"],"title":"The aging brain shows less flexible reallocation of cognitive resources during dual-task walking: a mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saskia M Waechter","Conor Fearon","Conor McDonnell","J Gallego","Brendan Quinlivan","Isabelle Killane","John S Butler","Timothy Lynch","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435708800,"objectID":"2dd1b2c0d26653f25f37bffec1f1b604","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2015_waechteretal-ieee_neuraleng/","publishdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_waechteretal-ieee_neuraleng/","section":"publication","summary":"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common disabling gait disorder in late stage Parkinson's disease (PD), which can lead to falls and loss of independence.

Considerable work indicates oscillatory synchronization through phase alignment is a major agent of inter-regional communication. In the brain, different oscillatory phases correspond to low- and high-excitability states. Optimally aligned phases (or high-excitability states) promote inter-regional communication. Studies have also shown that sensory stimulation can modulate or reset the phase of ongoing cortical oscillations. For example, auditory stimuli can reset the phase of oscillations in visual cortex, influencing processing of a simultaneous visual stimulus. Such cross-regional phase reset represents a candidate mechanism for aligning oscillatory phase for inter-regional communication. Here, we explored the role of local and inter-regional phase alignment in driving a well established behavioral correlate of multisensory integration: the redundant target effect (RTE), which refers to the fact that responses to multisensory inputs are substantially faster than to unisensory stimuli. In a speeded detection task, human epileptic patients (N = 3) responded to unisensory (auditory or visual) and multisensory (audiovisual) stimuli with a button press, while electrocorticography was recorded over auditory and motor regions. Visual stimulation significantly modulated auditory activity via phase reset in the delta and theta bands. During the period between stimulation and subsequent motor response, transient synchronization between auditory and motor regions was observed. Phase synchrony to multisensory inputs was faster than to unisensory stimulation. This sensorimotor phase alignment correlated with behavior such that stronger synchrony was associated with faster responses, linking the commonly observed RTE with phase alignment across a sensorimotor network.","tags":["Visual","Auditory","Multisensory","Electro-corticography (ECoG)","Oscillations"],"title":"Neuro-Oscillatory Phase Alignment Drives Speeded Multisensory Response Times: An Electro-Corticographic Investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S Butler","Anna Molloy","Laura Williams","Okka Kimmich","Brendan Quinlivan","Sean O'Riordan","Michael Hutchinson","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1433116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433116800,"objectID":"68f6cc91eda48012f0d701e516010c3f","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2015_butler-et-al-tdt/","publishdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_butler-et-al-tdt/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective.

By examining environmental exposure history in cervical dystonia patients and their similarly aged unaffected siblings we aimed to determine the role of previous environmental exposures in relation to disease penetrance. Methods A case-control study of 67 patients with cervical dystonia and 67 of their age-matched unaffected siblings was performed.

When incongruent auditory and visual information is presented concurrently, it can hinder a listener‚Äôs perception and even cause him or her to perceive information that was not presented in either modality. Efforts to investigate the neural basis of these effects have often focused on the special case of discrete audiovisual syllables that are spatially and temporally congruent, with less work done on the case of natural, continuous speech. Recent electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that cortical response measures to continuous auditory speech can be easily obtained using multivariate analysis methods. Here, we apply such methods to the case of audiovisual speech and, importantly, present a novel framework for indexing multisensory integration in the context of continuous speech. Specifically, we examine how the temporal and contextual congruency of ongoing audiovisual speech affects the cortical encoding of the speech envelope in humans using electro- encephalography. We demonstrate that the cortical representation of the speech envelope is enhanced by the presentation of congruent audiovisual speech in noise-free conditions. Furthermore, we show that this is likely attributable to the contribution of neural generators that are not particularly active during unimodal stimulation and that it is most prominent at the temporal scale corresponding to syllabic rate (2‚Äì 6 Hz). Finally, our data suggest that neural entrainment to the speech envelope is inhibited when the auditory and visual streams are incongruent both temporally and contextually.","tags":["Visual","Auditory","EEG","Multisensory","Stimulus reconstruction","Speech"],"title":"Congruent Visual Speech Enhances Cortical Entrainment to Continuous Auditory Speech in Noise-Free Conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Williams","John S Butler","Anna Molloy","Eavan McGovern","Ines Beiser","Okka Kimmich","Brendan Quinlivan","Sean O'Riordan","Michael Hutchinson","Richard B Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d0ec728ace8005cc52411ef710f92e56","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2015_williams-gender-dimorphism/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_williams-gender-dimorphism/","section":"publication","summary":"The temporal discrimination threshold (TDT) is the shortest time interval at which two sensory stimuli presented sequentially are detected as asynchronous by the observer.

In 175 participants (88 women) aged 20‚Äì65 years, temporal discrimination was faster in women than in men under the age of 40 years by a mean of approximately 13 ms. However, age-related decline in temporal discrimination was three times faster in women so that, in the age group of 40‚Äì65 years, the female superiority was reversed. The point of subjective equality showed a similar advantage in younger women and more marked age-related decline in women than men, as the TDT.

A wealth of previous research in the field of multisensory integration has shown that if different sensory signals are spatially or temporally discrepant, they may not combine in a statistically optimal fashion; however, this has not been well explored for visual‚Äìvestibular integration. Self-motion perception involves the integration of various movement parameters including displacement, velocity, acceleration and higher derivatives such as jerk. It is often assumed that the vestibular system is optimized for the processing of acceleration and higher derivatives, while the visual system is specialized to process position and velocity. In order to determine the interactions between different spatiotemporal properties for self-motion perception, in Experiment 1 we first asked whether the velocity profile of a visual trajectory affects discrimination performance in a heading task. Participants performed a two-interval forced choice heading task while stationary. They were asked to make heading discriminations while the visual stimulus moved at a constant velocity (C-Vis) or with a raised cosine velocity (R-Vis) motion profile. Experiment 2 was designed to assess how the visual and vestibular velocity profiles combined during the same heading task. In this case, participants were seated on a Stewart motion platform and motion information was presented via visual information alone, vestibular information alone or both cues combined. The combined condition consisted of congruent blocks (R-Vis/R-Vest) in which both visual and vestibular cues consisted of a raised cosine velocity profile and incongruent blocks (C-Vis/R-Vest) in which the visual motion profile consisted of a constant velocity motion, while the vestibular motion consisted of a raised cosine velocity profile. Results from both Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that visual heading estimates are indeed affected by the velocity profile of the movement trajectory, with lower thresholds observed for the R-Vis compared to the C-Vis. In Exp. 2 when visual‚Äìvestibularinputs were both present, they were combined in a statistically optimal fashion irrespective of the type of visual velocity profile, thus demonstrating robust integration of visual and vestibular cues. The study suggests that while the time course of the velocity did affect visual heading judgments, a moderate conflict between visual and vestibular motion profiles does not cause a breakdown in optimal integration for heading.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory"],"title":"Optimal visual‚Äìvestibular integration under conditions of conflicting intersensory motion profiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gizely N Andrade","Sophie Molholm","Alice B Brandwien","John S Butler","Steve U Walkley","John J Foxe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409529600,"objectID":"174a4fdeab3faf7021829d86d4fc8eef","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2014_andradeetal2014_npc_avsrt/","publishdate":"2014-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_andradeetal2014_npc_avsrt/","section":"publication","summary":"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disease in which cholesterol and glycosphingolipids accumulate in lysosomes due to aberrant cell-transport mechanisms. It is characterized by progressive and ultimately terminal neurological disease, but both pre-clinical studies and direct human trials are underway to test the safety and efficacy of cholesterol clearing compounds, with good success already observed in animal models. Key to assessing the effectiveness of interventions in patients, however, is the development of objective neurobiological outcome measures. Multisensory integration mechanisms present as an excellent candidate since they necessarily rely on the fidelity of long-range neural connections between the respective sensory cortices (e.g. the auditory and visual systems). A simple way to test integrity of the multisensory system is to ask whether individuals respond faster to the occurrence of a bisensory event than they do to the occurrence of either of the unisensory constituents alone. Here, we presented simple auditory, visual, and audio-visual stimuli in random sequence. Participants responded as fast as possible with a button push. One 11-year-old and two 14-year-old boys with NPC participated in the experiment and their results were compared to those of 35 age-matched neurotypical boys. Reaction times (RTs) to the stimuli when presented simultaneously were significantly faster than when they were presented alone in the neurotypical children, a facilitation that could not be accounted for by probability summation, as evidenced by violation of the so-called ‚Äòrace‚Äô model. In stark contrast, the NPC boys showed no such speeding, despite the fact that their unisensory RTs fell within the distribution of RTs observed in the neurotypicals. These results uncover a previously undescribed deficit in multisensory integrative abilities in NPC, with implications for ongoing treatment of the clinical symptoms of these children. They also suggest that multisensory processes may represent a good candidate biomarker against which to test the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.","tags":["Audio","Visual","Multisensory","Niemann-Pick type C disease","Behavioural"],"title":"Atypical multisensory integration in Niemann-Pick type C disease ‚Äì towards potential biomarkers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alice B.

We compared behavioral and ERP measures associated with performing a Go/NoGo response-inhibition task under conditions where participants (N=18) sat stationary, walked deliberately or walked briskly. This allowed for assessment of effects of increasing dual-task load (i.e. walking speed) on neural indices of inhibitory control. Stride time and variability were also measured during inhibitory task performance and compared to stride parameters without task performance, thereby assessing reciprocal dual-task effects on gait parameters. There were no task performance differences between sitting and either walking condition, indicating that participants could perform both tasks simultaneously without suffering dual-task costs. However, participants took longer strides under dual-task load, likely indicating an adaptive mechanism to reduce inter-task competition for cortical resources. We found robust differences in amplitude, latency and topography of ERP components (N2 and P3) associated with inhibitory control between the sitting and walking conditions.

Abnormal temporal discrim- ination is a mediational endophenotype of cervical dystonia and informs new concepts of disease pathogenesis. Our hypothesis is that both abnormal temporal discrimination and cervical dystonia are due to a disorder of the midbrain network for covert attentional orient- ing caused by reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition, resulting, in turn, from as yet undetermined, genetic mutations. Such disinhibition is (a) subclinically manifested by abnormal temporal discrimination due to prolonged duration firing of the visual sensory neurons in the superficial laminae of the superior colliculus and (b) clinically manifested by cervical dystonia due to disinhibited burst activity of the cephalomotor neurons of the inter- mediate and deep laminae of the superior colliculus. Abnormal temporal discrimination in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with cervical dystonia represents a subclinical manifestation of defective GABA activity both within the superior colliculus and from the substantia nigra pars reticulata.

Many studies have shown that sensory information is integrated using a weighted linear sum, yet little is known about whether this holds true for the integration of visual and body-based cues for travelled distance perception. In this study using Virtual Reality technologies, participants first travelled a predefined distance and subsequently matched this distance by adjusting an egocentric, in-depth target. The visual stimulus consisted of a long hallway and was presented in stereo via a head-mounted display. Body-based cues were provided either by walking in a fully tracked free-walking space (Exp. 1) or by being passively moved in a wheelchair (Exp. 2). Travelled distances were provided either through optic flow alone, body-based cues alone or through both cues combined. In the combined condition, visually specified distances were either congruent (1.09) or incongruent (0.79 or 1.49) with distances specified by body-based cues. Responses reflect a consistent combined effect of both visual and body-based information, with an overall higher influence of body-based cues when walking and a higher influence of visual cues during passive movement. When comparing the results of Experiments 1 and 2, it is clear that both proprioceptive and vestibular cues contribute to travelled distance estimates during walking.

Psychophysical studies have shown that manipulating frequency in audition or touch can have a significant cross-sensory impact on perceived frequency in the other sensory system, pointing to intimate links between these senses during computation of frequency. In this regard, the frequency of a vibratory event can be thought of as a multisensory perceptual construct. In turn, electrophysiological studies point to temporally early multisensory interactions that occur in hierarchically early sensory regions where convergent inputs from the auditory and somatosen- sory systems are to be found. A key question pertains to the level of processing at which the multisensory integration of featural information, such as frequency, occurs. Do the sensory systems calculate frequency independently before this information is combined, or is this feature calculated in an integrated fashion during preattentive sensory processing? The well characterized mismatch negativity, an electrophysiological response that indexes preattentive detection of a change within the context of a regular pattern of stimulation, served as our dependent measure.

In this study, high-density electroencephalographic recordings were deployed to investigate the neural processes associated with vestibular detection of changes in heading. To this end, a self-motion oddball paradigm was designed. Participants were translated linearly 7.8 cm on a motion platform using a one second motion profile, at a 45¬∞ angle leftward or rightward of straight ahead. These headings were presented with a stimulus probability of 80‚Äì20 %. Participants responded when they detected the infrequent direction change via button-press. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated in response to the standard (80 %) and target (20 %) movement directions. Statistical parametric mapping showed that ERPs to standard and target movements differed significantly from 490 to 950 ms post-stimulus. Topographic analysis showed that this difference had a typical P3 topography. Individual participant bootstrap analysis revealed that 93.3 % of participants exhibited a clear P3 component. These results indicate that a perceived change in vestibular heading can readily elicit a P3 response, wholly similar to that evoked by oddball stimuli presented in other sensory modalities.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in social cognition and are associated with abnormalities in sensory and perceptual processes. Several groups have reported that individuals with ASD are impaired in their ability to integrate socially relevant audiovisual (AV) information, and it has been suggested that this contributes to the higher-order social and cognitive deficits observed in ASD. However, successful integration of auditory and visual inputs also influences detection and perception of nonsocial stimuli, and integration deficits may impair earlier stages of information processing, with cascading downstream effects. To assess the integrity of basic AV integration, we recorded high-density electrophysiology from a cohort of highfunctioning children with ASD (7‚Äì16 years) while they performed a simple AV reaction time task. Children with ASD showed considerably less behavioral facilitation to multisensory inputs, deficits that were paralleled by less effective neural integration. Evidence for processing differences relative to typically developing children was seen as early as 100 ms poststimulation, and topographic analysis suggested that children with ASD relied on different cortical networks during this early multisensory processing stage.","tags":["Visual","Auditory","EEG","Autism","Multisensory","Development"],"title":"The Development of Multisensory Integration in High-Functioning Autism; High-Density Electrical Mapping and Psychophysical Measures Reveal Impairments in the Processing of Audiovisual Inputs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ian C Fiebelkorn","John J Foxe","John S Butler","Manuel R Mercier","Sophie Molholm"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1309478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1309478400,"objectID":"e0fcf78722b93316aab9debe0c30d8c2","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2011_fiebelkornetal2012_jon/","publishdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011_fiebelkornetal2012_jon/","section":"publication","summary":"The simultaneous presentation of a stimulus in one sensory modality often enhances target detection in another sensory modality, but the neural mechanisms that govern these effects are still under investigation. Here, we test a hypothesis proposed in the neurophysiological literature; that auditory facilitation of visual-target detection operates through cross-sensory phase reset of ongoing neural oscillations (Lakatos et al., 2009). To date, measurement limitations have prevented this potentially powerful neural mechanism from being directly linked with its predicted behavioral consequences. The present experiment uses a psychophysical approach in humans to demonstrate, for the first time, stimulus-locked periodicity in visual-target detection, following a temporally informative sound.Ourdata furtherdemonstrate that periodicity in behavioral performance is strongly influenced by the probability of audiovisual co-occurrence.Weargue that fluctuations in visual-target detection result from cross-sensory phase reset, both at the moment it occurs and persisting for seconds thereafter. The precise frequency at which this periodicity operates remains to be determined through a method that allows for a higher sampling rate.","tags":["Audio","Visual","Multisensory","Behavioural","Oscillations"],"title":"Ready, Set, Reset; Stimulus-Locked Periodicity in Behavioral Performance Demonstrates the Consequences of Cross-Sensory Phase Rese","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S Butler","Jennifer L Campos","Heinrich H B√ºlthoff","Stuart T Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1309478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1309478400,"objectID":"9baf9cc7ff95ce25e093b49a23f3c1ee","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2012_butleretal2012/","publishdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_butleretal2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Self-motion through an environment stimulates several sensory systems, including the visual system and the vestibular system. Recent work in heading estimation has demonstrated that visual and vestibular cues are typically integrated in a statistically optimal manner, consistent with Maximum Likelihood Estimation predictions. However, there has been some indication that cue integration may be affected by characteristics of the visual stimulus. Therefore, the current experiment evaluated whether presenting optic flow stimuli stereoscopically, or presenting both eyes with the same image (binocularly) affects combined visual‚Äì vestibular heading estimates. Participants performed a two-interval forced-choice task in which they were asked which of two presented movements was more rightward. They were presented with either visual cues alone, vestibular cues alone or both cues combined. Measures of reliability were obtained for both binocular and stereoscopic conditions. Group level analyses demonstrated that when stereoscopic information was available there was clear evidence of optimal integration, yet when only binocular information was available weaker evidence of cue integration was observed. Exploratory individual analyses demonstrated that for the stereoscopic condition 90% of participants exhibited optimal integration, whereas for the binocular condition only 60% of participants exhibited results consistent with optimal integration. Overall, these findings suggest that stereo vision may be important for self-motion perception, particularly under combined visual‚Äìvestibular conditions.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory","Bayesian"],"title":"The Role of Stereo Vision in Visual‚ÄìVestibular Integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Nolan","Robert Whelan","Richard B.

Thus, these properties can be said to be sensory-independent or amodal.Akey question is whethercommonmultisensory cortical regions process these amodal features, or does each sensory system contain its own specialized region(s) for processing common features? We tackled this issue by investigating simple duration-detection mechanisms across audition and touch; these systems were chosen because fine duration discriminations are possible in both. The mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the human event-related potential provides a sensitive metric of duration processing and has been elicited independently during both auditory and somatosensory investigations. Employing high-density electroencephalographic recordings in conjunction with intracranial subdural recordings, we asked whether fine duration discriminations, represented by the MMN, were generated in the same cortical regions regardless of the sensory modality being probed. Scalp recordings pointed to statistically distinct MMN topographies across senses, implying differential underlying cortical generator configurations. Intracranial recordings confirmed these noninvasive findings, showing generators of the auditoryMMN along the superior temporal gyrus with no evidence of a somatosensoryMMNin this region, whereas a robust somatosensory MMN was recorded from postcentral gyrus in the absence of an auditoryMMN.The current data clearly argue against a common circuitry account for amodal duration processing.","tags":["Somatosensory","Auditory","EEG","Multisensory","Intracranial"],"title":"Common or Redundant Neural Circuits for Duration Processing across Audition and Touch","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ian C.

However, little is known about the specific weighting of visual information when combined with proprioceptive inputs alone, in the absence of vestibular information about forward selfmotion. Therefore, in this study, participants walked in place on a stationary treadmill while dynamic visual information was updated in real time via a head-mounted display. The task required participants to travel a predefined distance and subsequently match this distance by adjusting an egocentric, in-depth target using a game controller.Travelled distance information was provided either throughvisual cues alone, proprioceptive cues alone or both cues combined. In the combined cue condition, the relationship between the two cues was manipulated by either changing the visual gain across trials (0.7√ó, 1.0√ó, 1.4√ó; Exp. 1) orthe proprioceptive gain across trials (0.7√ó, 1.0√ó, 1.4√ó; Exp. 2). Results demonstrated an overall higher weighting of proprioception over vision. These weights were scaled, however, as a function of which sensory input provided more stable information across trials. Specifically, when visual gain was constantly manipulated, proprioceptive weights were higher than when proprioceptive gain was constantly manipulated. These results therefore reveal interesting characteristics of cue-weighting within the context of unfolding spatio-temporal cue dynamics.","tags":["Visual","Vestibular","Self-motion","Multisensory"],"title":"Contributions of visual and proprioceptive information to travelled distance estimation during changing sensory congruencies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Soyka","Harold Teufel","Karl Beykirch","Paolo Robuffo-Giordano","John S Butler","Frank M Nieuwenhuizen","Heinrich H B√ºlthoff"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1251763200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1251763200,"objectID":"5d2fc657f74120c8d8a476cb52c2e889","permalink":"https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/publication/2009_soykaetal2009_jerk/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2009_soykaetal2009_jerk/","section":"publication","summary":"Perceptual thresholds for the detection of the direction of linear motion are important for motion simulation.

However, little attention has been given to possible dietary influences in myopia. This study demonstrates that serum zinc has no relationship with myopia development. Background: Myopia is inherently associated with eye growth and thereby possibly amenable to nutritional influence. A number of Asian studies have reported lower levels of serum zinc in myopic children. This study was designed to assess the relationship between serum zinc and myopia in the Korean population ‚Äì using a subsample of participants from nationally representative data. Methods: Data from the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2010 were used to explore zinc status in relation to refraction. A total of 304 participants were analysed, ranging in age from 12 to 19-years. Serum zinc levels were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, while refractive error was determined by non‚Äêcycloplegic autorefraction. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the association. Results: A significant majority of participants (n = 255; 84 per cent) were myopic. There was no significant difference in serum zinc levels between myopic and non‚Äêmyopic children (p = 0.81). In multivariate logistic regression, serum zinc was not significantly associated with myopia after adjustment for age, gender, residence, body mass index, family income and recreational activity. Similarly, no relationship was observed between spherical equivalent refraction and serum zinc within the myopic group (p = 0.46). Conclusion: In a subset of 12‚Äì19‚Äêyear‚Äêold participants from the population‚Äêrepresentative KNHANES study, no association was found between serum zinc and myopia. However, the lack of a sensitive biomarker for zinc status remains a major limitation in this, and all current studies.","tags":["Optometry"],"title":"The relationship between serum zinc levels and myopia","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Visual Vestibular Integration I investigate the role of visual and vestibular inputs in self-motion (e.g. walking and driving) which I model using a Bayesian framework to make predictions of how the sensory cues combine.
